# Updating Documentation and Code Comments during Code Review

As you review code, it is essential to pay attention to the documentation and code comments affected by the changes made. This is important for several reasons:

- **Clarity and maintainability**: Code comments and documentation provide critical context and guidance to developers, enabling them to understand the purpose and functionality of specific code segments. Updated, accurate comments make maintaining and enhancing the codebase significantly easier.

- **Collaboration**: In a team-based environment, clear communication is crucial. Ensuring that documentation and code comments are up-to-date and accurate can reduce confusion, mitigate the risk of introducing bugs, and improve overall developer productivity.

- **Knowledge sharing**: As developers join or leave the team, the knowledge about the codebase should not be lost. Thorough documentation and code comments serve as a valuable knowledge transfer tool, allowing new team members to quickly grasp the workings of the existing code.

- **Reduced onboarding time**: Updated documentation and code comments can significantly reduce the time required for onboarding new developers. Instead of relying on other team members to explain specific code functionality, they can refer to the documentation and code comments to get up to speed quickly.

- **Code quality**: Regularly updating documentation and code comments can lead to better code quality. During the process, developers may identify potential refactorings, optimizations or inconsistencies, making the codebase more robust and maintainable.

To ensure that documentation and code comments remain updated and relevant, consider the following best practices during code review:

- Verify that the changes have not rendered existing documentation and code comments obsolete. If so, request that they be updated accordingly.
- Check that any new functionality introduced is properly documented and commented.
- Encourage the use of clear, concise language and avoid ambiguous terms that may cause confusion.
- Encourage the adherence to established documentation and commenting standards within the team or organization.

By consistently and diligently updating documentation and code comments during code review, you not only ensure that your codebase remains maintainable and robust but also nurture a collaborative and well-informed development team.
