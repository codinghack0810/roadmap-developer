# Break Down Complex Tasks into Smaller Easily Manageable PRs

Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, easily manageable PRs (Pull Requests) is an essential best practice for code reviews. This approach has numerous benefits that lead to an improved code review process and enhanced code quality.

### 1. Easier Reviews

Smaller PRs are less intimidating and easier to review. They allow developers to quickly understand the changes made and provide more accurate and actionable feedback. This ultimately leads to increased collaboration and faster iterations.

### 2. Reduced Cognitive Load

Smaller PRs alleviate cognitive load, allowing developers to focus on the specific task at hand. This helps reviewers maintain their undivided attention on understanding and evaluating specific parts of the change, resulting in a more thorough review.

### 3. Streamlined Workflows

Reduced PR size typically results in quicker approval and merging, which in turn accelerates the development process. Additionally, by breaking down complex tasks into smaller chunks, it becomes easier to track progress and to provide incremental updates to stakeholders.

### 4. Reduced Risk of Merge Conflicts

Larger PRs are more prone to potential merge conflicts, especially when multiple developers are working in parallel. Smaller PRs, on the other hand, minimize the risk of conflicts and can be quickly resolved if they arise.

### 5. Easier Debugging

Smaller PRs are typically easier to test, due to their focused scope. If a bug is found, it's easier to pinpoint the source of the issue in smaller PRs, providing a more efficient debugging process.

In summary, breaking down complex tasks into smaller PRs improves the code review process by making it easier for the reviewer to understand and provide feedback. This best practice results in quicker approvals, reduced risk of merge conflicts, and ultimately, higher code quality.
