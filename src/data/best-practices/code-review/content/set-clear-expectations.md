# Set clear expectations for code review turnaround times

Setting clear expectations for code review turnaround times is crucial in maintaining a productive development workflow. By establishing a standard timeframe for reviews, developers can better manage their time and expectations, ultimately leading to a more efficient process. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are delivered to users as quickly as possible, fostering a healthy and constantly improving codebase. 

**Importance of setting expectations for turnaround times:**

- **Accountability:** By setting deadlines, team members are held accountable for reviewing their colleagues' code in a timely manner. This prevents code from languishing in the review stages for extended periods and negatively affecting the development pipeline.

- **Reduced development time:** Quick turnaround times encourage rapid feedback and prompt resolution of issues, allowing developers to move forward with their projects and reduce overall development time.

- **Better prioritization:** When the team has a clear understanding of the expected review time, they can prioritize their tasks and code review obligations effectively, ensuring that critical changes receive attention first.

- **Improved collaboration:** When code reviews are conducted promptly, it fosters a more collaborative environment, allowing team members to discuss and address code concerns in real-time. This leads to a stronger, shared understanding of the codebase and improved overall code quality.

- **Motivation boost:** Setting clear expectations and meeting those timelines sends a strong message to the team that their work is valued and respected. This, in turn, boosts motivation and encourages a culture of continuous improvement.

To successfully implement clear expectations for code review turnaround times:

- Determine a standard deadline, such as 24 or 48 hours, based on your team's workflow and current priorities.
- Communicate this expectation to all team members and ensure that they understand the importance of meeting the specified turnaround time.
- Track performance and adjust the deadline as needed to maintain an efficient and effective code review process.

By prioritizing timely code reviews and setting clear expectations for turnaround times, development teams can maintain a high standard of code quality while promoting collaboration, accountability, and efficiency within their workflows.
