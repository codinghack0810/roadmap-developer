# Write the Documentation for the Feature or Changes If Required

Documentation is an essential aspect of software development. Properly written documentation makes it easier for other developers to understand the purpose of the code, how it works, and how to use it. As the developer who wrote or made changes to the code, you have the most knowledge about it, and hence writing documentation can be highly beneficial for everyone involved in the project.

Here are a few reasons why writing documentation is important:

- **Ease of understanding**: Comprehensive documentation helps your team members understand your code better. It provides a clear understanding of the functionality, inputs, outputs, and potential edge cases of the new feature or changes.

- **Saves time**: When the documentation is clear and concise, it saves time for other developers when they are reviewing your code or attempting to use it in the future. They won’t have to waste time trying to understand the purpose of your code, and they can spend more time focusing on other tasks.

- **Easier maintenance**: Documentation helps future developers easily maintain and modify the code. When implementation details are documented, it's easier for developers to spot potential issues, optimizing the code or fixing bugs.

- **Onboarding new team members**: Onboarding new developers to your project becomes much more manageable if there is documentation to go through. They can quickly gain insights into the codebase and start being productive sooner.

- **Establishes best practices**: Writing documentation for your code encourages you to plan, structure, and think about the long-term effects of your code. This practice helps you avoid creating hard-to-understand code – ultimately improving the overall quality of the project.

So, take the time to write documentation for your code. It's a best practice that not only benefits others in the team but also helps you solidify your understanding of the code you wrote. Remember, good documentation is a sign of a developer who cares about the maintainability and long-term success of their code.
