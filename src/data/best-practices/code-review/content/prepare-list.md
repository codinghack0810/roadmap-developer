# Requirement-Based Checklist in Code Review

One of the best practices in code review is to **prepare a list of items that should have been covered in the changes, based on the requirements**. This is important for a number of reasons:

- **Clarity**: By preparing a list beforehand, it ensures that the reviewer has a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations from the changes. This helps in evaluating the code from a more informed perspective.

- **Completeness**: It helps in verifying that all the necessary requirements have been addressed and implemented in the code changes. This checklist can be used as a reference to ensure no corner cases or requirements were overlooked during implementation.

- **Consistency**: Preparing a list of items based on requirements ensures consistency in code review. Different reviewers may focus on different aspects of the code, leading to inconsistent feedback. Creating a list of items that should be covered standardizes the review process and ensures everyone is on the same page.

- **Efficiency**: Listing out the requirements makes the code review process more efficient. Reviewers don't have to spend time trying to figure out what the code is trying to achieve - this context is readily available, and they can focus on evaluating the code itself.

- **Reducing Bias**: Having a list of items based on requirements helps to reduce bias in code review. By focusing on the actual requirements, it becomes easier for the reviewer to put personal preferences aside and stay objective in their evaluation.

To create an effective requirement-based checklist for code review, consider the following steps:

- Review the project documentation and understand the objectives of the changes being introduced.
- Break down the requirements into concise and clear items that can be easily checked during the review process.
- Organize these items into categories, such as functionality, security, performance, and code style.
- Prioritize the items based on criticality, ensuring that the most important items are reviewed first.
- Share the checklist with the team and update it as necessary when new requirements arise or existing ones change.

In conclusion, developing a checklist based on requirements is a crucial best practice in code review. It ensures clarity, completeness, consistency, efficiency, and reduces bias in the review process, ultimately leading to better quality code and a more productive team.
