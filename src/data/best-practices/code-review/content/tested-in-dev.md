# Verify Code Change Testing in Development Environment

It is crucial to ensure that code changes have been adequately tested in a development environment before it moves further in the review and deployment process. This is important for several reasons:

- **Identifying bugs early**: Rigorous testing in a development environment helps identify and fix any potential issues, bugs or regressions early in the process, which supports efficient development and better long-term code health.

- **Saving time and effort**: By testing code changes in a development environment, you can save time and effort for both the developers and the reviewers. Catching the errors early on reduces the back and forth between the team members, facilitating a smoother project completion.

- **Maintaining code quality**: Properly tested code in a development environment adheres to the organization's quality standards, contributing to the long-term stability and maintainability of the project.

- **Improving collaboration**: When code is thoroughly tested in a development environment, reviewers can focus on other aspects of the code, such as its logic, architecture, and design. This fosters a better understanding of the project among team members and promotes a better collaboration culture.

To effectively verify the testing of code changes in a development environment, consider the following best practices:

- Encourage developers to write and run unit tests, integration tests, and system tests to ensure that their code changes cover all the necessary test cases and scenarios.

- Verify that the test cases are comprehensive, relevant, and tested against possible edge cases, ensuring that the new code has minimal impact on the existing functionality and system stability.

- Request test results, logs, or screenshots as proof of proper testing during the code review process. This helps build confidence among reviewers and stakeholders that the code changes meet the desired level of quality and functionality.

By adhering to these best practices, you can create a robust, efficient, and successful code review process that promotes high-quality software development across your team.
