## Ensuring Completeness of Changes

Before submitting a pull request or requesting a code review, make sure the changes are complete and well-documented. This is important for several reasons:

- **Time Efficiency:** It's essential to ensure that your code is complete and functioning as intended before requesting a review, as this will save time for both you and the reviewer. Reviewing incomplete code can be frustrating, and may require re-reviewing the same code once the missing parts are added.

- **Code Quality:** Properly written, complete tests help maintain code quality by ensuring that the functionality of the code is thoroughly tested, and potential issues are identified before they can cause problems. Additionally, well-organized and comprehensive documentation ensures that other developers can understand and maintain code more easily, leading to more efficient and higher quality work.

- **Maintainability:** When a codebase is consistently well-documented, it becomes significantly easier to modify or extend in the future. Projects with poor documentation and incomplete tests can become difficult to maintain, leading to a decrease in overall code quality and increased technical debt. Making sure all necessary tests and documentation are included in a PR should be a key objective.

- **Ease of Collaboration:** Code review is often a collaborative process, where different team members might be reviewing different parts of the same code. Ensuring all relevant documentation and tests are complete and informative makes it easier for others to understand and review the proposed changes, fostering better collaboration within the team.

Ensuring the completeness of changes before submitting them for review is crucial for maintaining a high-quality, collaborative, and efficient development process. Remember to include all necessary tests and documentation, making it easier for your reviewers and improving the overall codebase.
