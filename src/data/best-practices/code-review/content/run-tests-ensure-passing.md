# Importance of Running Tests After Making Changes

Running tests and ensuring that they all pass after making changes to the code is a critical aspect of the code review process. This step is essential for a few reasons:

- **Identifying errors**: Running tests can help identify any issues or bugs that might have been introduced during the recent changes. This ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality or introduce new problems.

- **Code quality assurance**: Ensuring that all tests pass provides an added level of confidence in the quality and stability of the code. This is particularly important when collaborating with a team, as it helps maintain the expected level of code quality across the project.

- **Validating changes**: Tests are a form of documentation that express the intended behavior of the code, so ensuring they pass serves as an implicit confirmation that the changes are consistent with their intended purpose. This can be especially helpful for reviewers who may not be intimately familiar with the code in question.

- **Encouraging test-driven development**: By making it a best practice to run and pass tests after making changes, you encourage developers to adopt test-driven development practices, which helps create a more robust and maintainable codebase.

In summary, running tests and making sure they pass after making changes is a crucial best practice in code reviews. It helps catch issues early, ensures code quality, and validates your changes so you can confidently proceed with integrating them into the project.
