# Write Automated Tests

Writing **automated tests** is a crucial aspect of code review and overall software development. It is important for several reasons:

- **Ensure Correctness**: Automated tests verify that the code behaves as expected, covering various edge cases and scenarios. This helps catch bugs and errors during the development phase itself, resulting in a more stable and reliable product.

- **Prevent Regressions**: When changes are made to the codebase, automated tests ensure that existing functionality still works as intended. This reduces the chances of introducing new bugs and regressions, thereby maintaining the overall quality of the software.

- **Simplify Code Reviews**: Well-written tests serve as a form of documentation, demonstrating the developer's intent and thought process. This makes it easier for the code reviewer to understand the changes and provide constructive feedback.

- **Boost Development Speed**: Having a robust suite of automated tests allows developers to quickly refactor and improve the code with confidence. This accelerates the development process and facilitates the adoption of new technologies and techniques.

By investing time in writing comprehensive automated tests, you not only safeguard the interests of your users but also foster a culture of quality and continuous improvement within your development team. This results in a win-win situation for everyone involved.
