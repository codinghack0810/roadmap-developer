# Resolving Conflicting Opinions in a Timely Manner

It is essential to **resolve conflicting opinions in a timely manner** during a code review process. When disagreements arise, they can lead to the delay of the pull request (PR) and, consequently, slow down the overall progress of the project. Here's why timely resolution of such conflicts is important:

- **Maintain productivity**: Lengthy discussions and disagreements about a pull request can eat up valuable time of the team members, affecting their productivity. Addressing conflicts swiftly helps everyone to stay focused on delivering results.

- **Reduce code stagnation**: The longer a pull request remains open, the higher the chances that the code becomes outdated. Resolving conflicts early prevents the accumulation of additional work required to merge the PR with the updated codebase.

- **Minimize wasted efforts**: An unmerged pull request represents time and resources spent by the developer that may ultimately go to waste if the disagreement is not resolved. Swift conflict resolution ensures that the developer's efforts are efficiently utilized.

- **Foster a healthy team environment**: Unresolved disagreements can lead to frustration and resentment among team members. Addressing these issues promptly helps maintain a collaborative and positive atmosphere, leading to better teamwork and synergy.

To achieve a timely resolution of conflicting opinions, you may consider the following best practices:

- Encourage open, constructive, and respectful discussions.
- Evaluate the points objectively and consider their impact on the project.
- Seek input from other team members or experts if necessary.
- Ensure that the disagreement is focused on the code or technical aspects, rather than personal opinions or preferences.
- As the author, stay open to feedback and be ready to make changes or provide the necessary clarification.
- As the reviewer, provide clear, concise, and actionable feedback to help the author understand and address the concerns.

Ultimately, resolving conflicts in a timely manner during code reviews enables teams to work efficiently, maintain code quality, and foster a positive working environment.
