# Seek Feedback from Other Team Members If You Are Unsure About the Changes

It is important to seek feedback from other team members when you are unsure about the changes for a few reasons:

- **Diverse perspectives and experiences**: In a team, each member brings their own unique set of skills, experiences, and perspectives. By engaging others in the code review process, you are more likely to identify potential issues or improvements that you may have missed initially.

- **Shared ownership and knowledge**: Encouraging the involvement of others in the code review process helps foster a sense of shared responsibility and ownership of the codebase. This practice also allows for better knowledge transfer between team members, ensuring that more than one person is familiar with any given part of the codebase.

- **Reduced risk of bias**: As the author of a piece of code, it's natural to have certain biases or attachments to the implemented solution. Involving other team members in the code review process ensures that a fresh pair of eyes can review the code, providing feedback that might be less biased and more objective.

- **Continuous learning and improvement**: By seeking feedback from other team members, both the reviewer and author can learn from one another's insight and experiences. This continuous learning process helps the entire team to grow, adapt, and improve over time.

In conclusion, seeking feedback from other team members helps ensure a comprehensive, unbiased, informative, and robust code review process. By embracing this best practice, teams can benefit from collective knowledge and experiences, resulting in better-quality code, shared ownership, and continuous improvement.
