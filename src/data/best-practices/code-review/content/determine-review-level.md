# Determine the Appropriate Level of Review Needed Based on the Scope and Impact of the Code Change

Determining the appropriate level of review needed based on the scope and impact of the code change is a critical part of the code review process. This practice aims to save time, ensure quality, and manage risk effectively in the software development lifecycle. It is important for the following reasons:

- **Efficient use of resources:** Reviewing every single line of code can be time-consuming and may not always be the best use of the reviewer's time. By identifying the impact of the code change, we can allocate the right resources for a more thorough review where needed, while still maintaining quality in less critical areas. This can reduce the overall time spent on code reviews and increase productivity.

- **Identification of potential risks:** Some code changes may have a broader impact on the overall application and should be reviewed more closely to ensure that no unintended consequences are introduced. Knowing the scope and impact of a change can help reviewers focus on high-risk areas and identify potential issues that may have been overlooked otherwise.

- **Better communication:** Clearly defining the level of review needed facilitates better communication between the author and the reviewers, leading to a more efficient code review process. It helps both parties understand the expectations and significance of the code change, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

- **Maintaining code quality:** When we prioritize the review process based on the code change's scope, we ensure that the most critical parts of our application remain stable and maintain their quality. This, in turn, leads to a better end-product for the users.

In summary, determining the appropriate level of review needed based on the scope and impact of the code change can lead to a better allocation of resources, identification of potential risks, improved communication between the involved parties, and higher code quality across the application.
