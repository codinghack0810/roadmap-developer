# Importance of Reviewing Tests in Code Changes

Reviewing the tests included with a code change is a crucial aspect of the code review process. Ensuring that the tests adequately cover the functionality and edge cases provides numerous benefits, such as:

- **Robustness**: Thoroughly tested code is more resistant to bugs and unexpected failures. Evaluating the tests during the code review process helps to identify any missing cases or incorrect assumptions made by the developer. It also allows the reviewer to assess whether the tests are designed to handle edge cases and exceptions that might not be obvious at first glance.

- **Maintainability**: Well-tested code is easier to maintain and extend in the future. When developers can rely on a comprehensive suite of tests, they can confidently make changes to the codebase without worrying about introducing regressions. This helps to keep the project's overall quality high and ensures that improvements can be made more rapidly.

- **Collaboration**: By examining the tests as part of the code review process, the reviewer gains a deeper understanding of the new functionality or changes being introduced. This shared knowledge of the codebase is essential for fostering a collaborative environment where team members can effectively work together to build and maintain a high-quality product.

- **Documentation**: Tests can serve as a form of documentation, demonstrating how the code is expected to work and providing examples of its usage. Examining the tests during code review can help to ensure that the intended behavior and requirements are being met.

In summary, reviewing tests that accompany code changes is a critical aspect of the code review process. It helps to ensure that the code is robust, maintainable, and well-documented while promoting collaboration among team members. By carefully evaluating the tests associated with a code change, you can have increased confidence in the code's quality and stability.
