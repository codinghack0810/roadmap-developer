# Review the Updated Code and Ensure that the Suggested Changes Have been Implemented as Expected

This best practice is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Accuracy:** By reviewing the updated code, you ensure that the requested changes have been applied correctly. It's possible that misunderstandings could arise during the code review process; thus, it's essential to verify whether the changes align with the intended outcome.

- **Quality:** By confirming that the suggested changes have been implemented, you maintain the overall quality of the code. It is important that the developer has properly addressed your feedback and not merely "ticked the box." Continuous improvement of the codebase should be the goal.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Reviewing the updated code allows both the reviewer and the developer to learn from one another. It enables better understanding of different approaches to problem-solving and fosters the growth of the team's technical expertise.

- **Consistency:** Ensuring that the suggested changes have been executed as expected also helps maintain consistency in the codebase. This is especially important when working with a team, as a consistent code style and approach facilitates ease of understanding and collaboration.

- **Collaboration:** The process of reviewing updated code helps build a cooperative environment within the team. By working closely with the developer to ensure that changes have been implemented correctly, you enhance the relationship between the reviewer and the developer, promoting mutual respect and fostering collaboration.

In summary, reviewing updated code and ensuring the suggested changes have been implemented as expected is vital to maintain accuracy, quality, consistency, and promote knowledge sharing and collaboration within the team. By adhering to this best practice, you will significantly contribute to the overall success of your projects and the growth of your team's capabilities.
