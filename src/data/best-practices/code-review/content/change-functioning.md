## Verifying Code in the Production Environment

Verifying the deployed changes in production environment is critical to ensure your application's performance and stability, and helps avoid potential issues that might have not been evident during the testing phase. Always make sure that the code changes undergo thorough examination in the production environment during your code review process. Here are some reasons why this is important:

- **Discovering Potential Issues**: Despite a code's functionality in testing and staging environments, some problems might only surface in the production environment. This check helps uncover such issues, which could have been missed otherwise.

- **Consistency with Existing Systems**: Verifying code in the production environment helps ensure that new changes are compatible with the existing systems, and that the changes don't introduce unexpected behaviors, crashes, or other issues in the live application.

- **Performance Assurance**: Live traffic and workloads in the production environment may be entirely different compared to the test environments. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the new code performs well under real-life conditions too.

- **Data-related Issues**: The production environment often involves real user data, which might differ from the test data used during development. By verifying the changes in the production environment, data-related issues can be taken care of, ensuring smooth operation for the end-users.

- **Compliance and Security**: In many organizations, compliance and security are of utmost importance. Verifying that the code changes in the production environment adhere to the necessary regulations and security measures can prevent severe consequences like data leaks and security breaches.
