# Ensure that the Relevant Documentation has been Updated

Updating the relevant documentation is a crucial aspect of the code review process. This ensures that all team members, including future contributors, can understand the changes that have been made, how to use the modified code, and any potential effects of the changes. Below are key points on why this practice is important:

- **Maintain Comprehensibility**: Updated documentation enables both the author and the reviewers to understand the code and its impact more easily. This clarity paves the way for constructive feedback, which ultimately results in improved code quality.

- **Promote Consistency**: Comprehensive and up-to-date documentation helps ensure that a consistent style and approach are followed throughout the codebase. This consistency is vital in making the code easy to read and maintain.

- **Save Time and Effort**: Whenever a team member modifies a part of the codebase, they should update the accompanying documentation. By doing so, developers can save time and effort that would otherwise be spent deciphering code that lacks proper documentation.

- **Facilitates Onboarding and Collaboration**: Accurate, well-maintained documentation facilitates smooth onboarding for new team members and fosters collaboration among existing ones. Developers can confidently make changes to the code without worrying about unintended consequences, thanks to comprehensive documentation.

- **Helps with Code Maintenance**: By keeping documentation up-to-date, it becomes easier to perform ongoing maintenance tasks, such as bug fixes and feature enhancements. It further reduces the likelihood that future developers will inadvertently introduce new issues when making changes.

In conclusion, ensuring the documentation is updated as part of the code review process is essential for maintaining coherent, accessible, and maintainable codebases. It enhances collaboration within the team and contributes to the overall success of the project.
