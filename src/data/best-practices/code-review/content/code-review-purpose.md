# Common Understanding

Ensuring that the purpose of code reviews is clear to everyone is a crucial aspect of the review process. A transparent understanding of objectives enhances the efficiency of the process and fosters a positive environment for communication, teamwork, and learning.

Here's why it is important:

- **Shared Expectations:** When everyone is on the same page about the goals of the code review, it helps to set shared expectations among team members. This prevents frustrations or misunderstandings that could arise from differing expectations.

- **Efficient Reviews:** A clear understanding of the review's purpose allows developers to focus on the relevant aspects, such as code quality, functionality, or performance. This maximizes the efficiency of the process and saves valuable time for all contributors.

- **Better Collaboration:** When the purpose of the code review is clear to everyone, team members are more likely to collaborate effectively. This includes providing constructive feedback, offering alternative solutions, and supporting each other in their professional growth.

- **Continual Improvement:** Code reviews aim to improve code quality and maintainability. A well-defined purpose ensures that developers learn from each other, adopt best practices, and continuously improve the software development process.

- **Positive Environment:** Clearly communicating the purpose helps to create a positive atmosphere during the code review. It reinforces the idea that the process is about learning, collaboration, and quality improvement, instead of finding faults or assigning blame.

In summary, a transparent understanding of the purpose of code reviews is essential for effective collaboration, setting shared expectations, contributing to an efficient review process, fostering a positive environment for learning, and ensuring continual improvement of the software development process.
