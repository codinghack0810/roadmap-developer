# Seek Continuous Improvement, Not Perfection

As an author of this guide, I highly recommend focusing on continuous improvement instead of striving for perfection in your code review process. Here is why it is important:

- **Achievable goals**: Perfection is an unattainable goal, whereas continuous improvement sets realistic expectations of progress. You can measure and track improvement over time while remaining motivated.

- **Avoid discouragement**: Chasing perfection can lead to discouragement and frustration when the desired outcome isn't reached. By aiming for continuous improvement, you encourage consistent effort and results.

- **Enhance collaboration**: Perfection can create an environment where developers may hesitate to contribute their ideas, fearing criticism or rejection. Continuous improvement encourages participation, discussions, and a collaborative approach to problem-solving.

- **Innovation and evolution**: In software development, change is inevitable. Seeking continuous improvement allows you to adapt and stay ahead of the curve, embracing new technologies and best practices as they become available.

- **Efficient use of resources**: Perfection demands a lot of time and resources that may not always lead to desired results. Continuous improvement focuses on incremental changes, allowing you to optimize your resources and maximize output.

- **Reduced stress**: Striving for perfection can create a lot of unnecessary stress, negatively affecting the work environment and team morale. Focusing on continuous improvement helps maintain a healthier, more positive atmosphere.

In conclusion, to make the code review process effective and maintainable, seek continuous improvement rather than perfection. This approach prioritizes learning, collaboration, and growth, fostering a positive and productive work environment.
