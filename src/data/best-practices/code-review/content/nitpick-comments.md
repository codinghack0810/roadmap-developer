# Leave Comments to Suggest Improvements

During the code review process, it's essential to provide constructive feedback to the author of the code for possible improvements. These suggestions can help enhance code quality and readability, fostering a learning environment within the team. 

**Use "Nit" prefix for non-critical comments**

When providing feedback, it's important to distinguish between critical issues that must be resolved to meet the team's coding standards and non-critical suggestions that can be considered by the author. Using the term "Nit" before your comment helps in conveying that the suggestion is a "nitpick," which means it's optional or less important than other issues.

By prefixing your comment with "Nit", you are effectively communicating the following:

- **Prioritization**: It helps both the reviewer and the author in prioritizing the feedback. Critical issues should be addressed first, while non-critical suggestions can be considered later or even left unaddressed if necessary.

- **Respect**: Using "Nit" shows respect for the author's work and acknowledges their effort, ensuring that you are focused on providing constructive criticism without being overly critical or dogmatic.

- **Clear communication**: It helps in avoiding misunderstandings, reducing the chances of arguments or misinterpretations of your feedback. The author knows that this suggestion is not a hard requirement and they can decide whether to accept or ignore it.

_Additional tip: Be mindful of the tone of your comments â€“ try to keep the language respectful, supportive, and encourage a positive attitude._

**Example:**

Nit: Consider renaming this variable to `userCount` for better readability.

By following this best practice, you can effectively contribute to the growth of the team's collective knowledge, and ensure a smoother code review process that leads to high-quality code.
