# Keep the Short-term and Long-term Considerations in Mind

When conducting code reviews, it's essential to consider both short-term and long-term implications of the code changes being proposed. This approach helps ensure that the code remains manageable, scalable, and reliable in the long run while addressing immediate requirements.

### Why is it important?

- **Short-term considerations** predominantly focus on the correctness, readability, security, and performance of the code changes. Addressing these aspects allows the project to move forward smoothly, avoids immediate bugs or performance issues, and helps other team members to understand and work with the code.

- **Long-term considerations** involve evaluating the architectural impact, maintainability, and extensibility of the code changes. These aspects are crucial for the overall success of the project as they ensure that the codebase remains flexible and adaptable to future changes.

Considering both short-term and long-term aspects in a code review ensures that the codebase remains robust and maintainable. This approach minimizes potential technical debt, while also fostering a development environment where all team members can contribute effectively.

### Practical Tips

- Encourage reviewers to consider the code's impact on the overall system architecture and any potential future changes.
- Address potential performance bottlenecks or resource usage concerns that may grow with the scalability of the application.
- Evaluate whether code changes adhere to the project's established design patterns, naming conventions, and best practices, to maintain consistency and readability.
- Consider the robustness and resilience of the proposed code changes, especially in terms of error handling and edge case scenarios.
- Analyze the changes' impact on testability, requiring thorough automated test coverage for critical parts of the codebase.
- Assess the code's extensibility and modularity, which might include evaluating if the changes enable the easy addition or removal of features, or if they could be easily ported to other parts of the system.

By keeping both short-term and long-term considerations in mind during code reviews, your team's codebase will be well-positioned for continued growth, improvement, and success.
