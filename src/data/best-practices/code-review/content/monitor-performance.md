# Monitoring Performance and Functionality of Code Changes

Monitoring the performance and functionality of the code changes is an important aspect of the code review process. This helps ensure that the changes introduced do not have any negative impact on the overall application's performance or its core functionality. There are several reasons why this aspect is crucial for successful code reviews:

### Stability and Reliability

By monitoring the performance and functionality of code changes, you can ensure that the introduced changes do not break existing functionalities or make the application unstable. Addressing any issues that arise in this process helps maintain the stability and reliability of the application, which is crucial for user satisfaction and eliminating production issues.

### Early Detection of Potential Problems

Monitoring the impact of code changes allows you to detect potential problems and address them early on in the development cycle. This helps prevent issues from going unnoticed until it's too late and reduces the chances of costly and time-consuming bug fixes.

### Performance Optimization

Identifying and addressing any performance bottlenecks introduced by code changes ensures that your application remains efficient and responsive. This is especially important in applications that deal with a high volume of users or data processing, where even minor performance issues can have a significant impact on the overall user experience.

### Maintainability and Scalability

Monitoring and addressing issues related to code changes helps maintain and improve the maintainability of the codebase. This ensures that the application can be easily adjusted or extended in the future, thereby improving its scalability and ability to handle future growth and development requirements.

### Quality Assurance and User Satisfaction

Ensuring that code changes do not introduce performance issues or break existing functionalities helps maintain the quality of the application. This contributes to user satisfaction and trust in the application, which in turn can directly impact user retention and the overall success of the project.

In conclusion, by effectively monitoring the performance and functionality of the code changes during the code review process, you can identify and address any issues at an early stage. This ensures that the application remains stable, reliable, and efficient, ultimately contributing to its overall success.
