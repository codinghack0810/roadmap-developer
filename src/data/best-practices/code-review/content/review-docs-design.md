# Review Documentation and Design Specifications

One important aspect of a code review is to **review any documentation or design specifications related to the change** that is being introduced by the developer. This is crucial for several reasons:

- **Ensure Consistency**: Any changes to the codebase should align with the existing documentation and design specifications. Reviewing these documents helps to make sure that the implemented changes remain consistent with the intended design and functionality.

- **Verify Requirements**: Documentation and design specifications contain the requirements for the project or feature. Checking the code against these requirements ensures that the change meets the initial goals and objectives.

- **Facilitate Understanding**: Examining documentation or design specifications can help reviewers gain a better understanding of the change and its impact on the system. This leads to a more effective review process and better-informed decisions regarding the changes in question.

- **Detect Issues Early**: By cross-validating the code against its corresponding documentation, reviewers can identify potential issues, discrepancies, or inconsistencies before they become bigger problems. This ensures more efficient development and helps avoid costly mistakes down the line.

- **Improve Documentation Quality**: A review of documentation and design specifications might reveal inaccuracies, uncertainties, or gaps that need to be addressed. In this way, code reviews play a vital role in maintaining the quality and clarity of project documentation, which benefits the entire development team.

In summary, reviewing documentation and design specifications during a code review is essential for ensuring consistency with the intended design, meeting project requirements, facilitating understanding of changes, detecting issues early and maintaining high-quality project documentation.
