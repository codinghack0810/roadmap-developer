# Ensure that "Definition of Done" is documented and clear to everyone

The "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a crucial aspect of the code review process, as it establishes clear and shared expectations for the quality, functionality, and completeness of the work being submitted. A well-defined DoD helps to ensure that all team members understand the requirements for a feature or task, and it provides a set of objective criteria that can be used to assess the readiness of code for merging or deployment.

#### Why is it important?

- **Consistent expectations**: Having a clear DoD enables team members to have a common understanding of what constitutes a high-quality, complete piece of work. This reduces misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is on the same page with regards to the expected outcome.
- **Efficient code reviews**: When reviewers have a well-defined set of criteria to assess the submitted work, they can perform more focused and efficient code reviews. This helps to minimize the time spent on reviewing and the back-and-forth between the author and the reviewers.
- **Improved quality**: A DoD that includes specific quality criteria, such as adherence to coding standards, test coverage, and performance requirements, helps encourage developers to produce high-quality code. By ensuring that all code meets these criteria before being considered "done," the overall quality of the codebase is maintained.
- **Objective assessment**: A clear DoD acts as an objective benchmark for determining whether a piece of work is truly "done." This can help to reduce bias and personal preferences in the review process, and it ensures that all code is held to the same high standard.
- **Facilitates communication**: Having a documented DoD facilitates communication between the team members, especially when new members join the team. It sets a foundation for understanding the requirements and quality standards expected from everyone.

#### Implementing a Clear DoD

To create a clear and effective DoD for your team, consider the following steps:

- Collaborate with your team to define the criteria required for work to be considered "done." This may include tasks such as writing tests, adhering to code style guides, and passing Continuous Integration builds.

- Document the agreed-upon DoD, and make it easily accessible to all team members. This could mean including it in the project's documentation, adding it to the team's internal wiki, or even posting it on a shared virtual bulletin board.

- Ensure that the DoD is communicated to all team members and that everyone understands the criteria. Provide training or resources as needed to help team members meet the defined standards.

- Regularly review and update the DoD to ensure it remains accurate and relevant. Encourage team members to contribute new insights and suggestions for improvement.
