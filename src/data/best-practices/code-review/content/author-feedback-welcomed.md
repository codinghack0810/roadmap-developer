## Be Open to Feedback

It is important for code reviewers to **be open to feedback from the author** and **be willing to make adjustments** to their feedback if necessary. This is crucial for a few reasons:

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Code reviews are an opportunity for teamwork and open discussion. Being receptive to the code author's perspective and suggestions fosters a collaborative environment, allowing both parties to learn from each other and improve the quality of the code.

- **Respect and Trust**: When you're open to feedback, you convey respect for the author's experience, skill, and efforts, which helps to build trust in the team. Trust is essential for facilitating honest and productive conversations during code reviews.

- **Continuous Learning**: Code reviewers are not infallible, and sometimes, they may misunderstand or miss certain aspects of the code. Being open to feedback from the author helps code reviewers to learn and adapt their approach, eventually improving their reviewing skills.

- **Finding the Best Solution**: Quite often, there is more than one way to resolve an issue in the code. By being open and willing to adjust your feedback, you give space for different perspectives and ideas, often leading to the best possible solution.

In summary, being open to feedback and making adjustments during code reviews significantly contributes to creating a healthy, collaborative, and efficient development process.
