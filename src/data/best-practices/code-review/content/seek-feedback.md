# Encourage Authors to Seek Feedback During Development Before Submitting a Formal Code Review

It is important to encourage authors to seek feedback during the development phase, prior to submitting a formal code review, for several reasons:

- **Early Detection of Issues:** Discussing the code with peers while it's being developed can help identify potential problems, misconceptions or areas that may need clarification earlier in the process. This can lead to a more robust and stable codebase with fewer bugs and issues at the time of review, making the review process more efficient.

- **Better Code Comprehension:** When developers seek feedback during development, it provides an opportunity for team members to understand the rationale behind their design choices and overall approach. This makes it easier for the reviewer to comprehend the code, leading to a more effective review process.

- **Shared Ownership:** When a developer discusses their code with others during development, it encourages shared ownership and responsibility for the quality of the final product. This can foster a more collaborative and supportive coding environment, leading to an overall improvement in team productivity and code quality.

- **Faster Resolution of Conflicts:** If disagreements arise about the direction or implementation of a feature, seeking feedback during development allows for earlier resolution of conflicts, reducing the chances of time-consuming and potentially contentious discussions during the formal code review process.

- **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** By discussing the code with peers as it's being developed, developers can absorb new ideas, best practices, and alternative solutions from their colleagues. This continuous exchange of feedback and ideas encourages growth and allows individual developers to improve their skills at a faster rate.

In summary, encouraging authors to seek feedback during development helps promote a more collaborative environment, improves the overall comprehension of code, ensures early identification of issues, and fosters continuous learning and improvement. This ultimately results in a more efficient code review process and a higher quality codebase.
