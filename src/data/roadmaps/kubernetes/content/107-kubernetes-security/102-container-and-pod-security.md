# Container and Pod Security

Kubernetes (k8s) can secure containers and pods through measures like using trusted container images, limiting container privileges, enforcing pod-level security policies, implementing network security measures, using access controls with RBAC, and managing sensitive information with Secrets and ConfigMaps. These practices help organizations reduce the risk of security incidents in their k8s clusters.
