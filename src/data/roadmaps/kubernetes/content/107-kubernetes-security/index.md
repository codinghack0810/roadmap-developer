# Kubernetes Security

Kubernetes (k8s) security involves protecting against potential threats to a cluster's resources, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks. This can be achieved through measures such as access controls, network security, encryption, and monitoring. Common tools used for k8s security include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Kubernetes Network Policies, TLS certificates, and container image scanning. Regular updates and patches to the k8s environment are also important to maintain security.
