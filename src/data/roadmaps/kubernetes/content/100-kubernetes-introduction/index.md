# Kubernetes Introduction

Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a way to abstract the underlying infrastructure and manage applications at scale, while also offering flexibility, portability, and a rich feature set. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its widespread adoption, active community, and ability to handle complex, multi-tiered applications.
