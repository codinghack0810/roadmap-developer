flutter_bloc is a Flutter package that implements the BLoC pattern and provides a set of tools for building BLoC-based apps. It provides a set of widgets, such as `BlocProvider` and `BlocBuilder`, that make it easier to implement the BLoC pattern in your app. It also provides utility classes, such as `Bloc` and `BlocEvent`, that help you to write reusable and testable business logic components.
