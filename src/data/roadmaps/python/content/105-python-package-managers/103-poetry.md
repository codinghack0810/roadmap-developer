# Poetry

Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Poetry efficiently installs, manages, and updates packages and their dependencies. Poetry seamlessly creates, saves, loads, and switches between project environments on your local computer. It is designed specifically for Python projects, providing a streamlined workflow for managing dependencies, virtual environments, and building packages.

Poetry as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you need a specific version of a package or a different version of Python, Poetry handles both dependency management and virtual environments effortlessly. With just a few commands, you can set up a completely isolated environment to run a different version of Python or package configuration, while maintaining your usual development environment. Poetryâ€™s lock file ensures consistent installs across different environments, enhancing reproducibility and stability of your projects.
