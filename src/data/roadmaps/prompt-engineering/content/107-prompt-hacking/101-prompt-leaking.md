# Prompt Leaking

Prompt leaking is a phenomenon that occurs when the model starts incorporating or internalizing the assumptions and biases present in the prompt itself. Instead of focusing on providing accurate, unbiased information or response, the model might end up reinforcing the inherent biases in the question, leading to results that are not useful, controversial, or potentially harmful.

## Causes

1. **Inherent Biases**: GPT-3 and other state-of-the-art language models are trained on large and diverse datasets. Unfortunately, these datasets also contain many biases that can be embedded into the models, and may come into play during the response generation process.

2. **Biased Prompt**: When the prompt provided by the user contains biased phrases or loaded questions, it can influence the model unintentionally and cause prompt leaking. This kind of bias may lead the model to produce an undesired output conforming to the assumptions in the question. 

## Prevention and Strategies

To prevent or mitigate prompt leaking, consider these strategies:

1. **Neutralize the prompt**: Try to rephrase the prompt in a more neutral way or remove any biases present, focusing the question on the desired information.

2. **Counter biases**: If you know a particular bias is involved, build a prompt that counteracts the bias and pushes the model towards a more balanced response.

3. **Use Step-by-Step Instruction**: Guide the model step-by-step or ask the model to think through the reasoning before answering the main question. This can help you steer the model towards the desired response.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: You can adopt an iterative approach to ask the model to improve or further clarify its response, enabling it to rectify potential biases in prior responses.

5. **Model Understanding**: Enhance your understanding of the model's behavior and identify its strengths and weaknesses. This can help you better prepare the prompt and avoid biases.
