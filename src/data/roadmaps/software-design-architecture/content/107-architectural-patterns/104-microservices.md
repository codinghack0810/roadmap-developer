# Microservices

Microservices is an architectural pattern that is used to design software systems as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. The main advantage of a microservices architecture is that it allows for a more flexible and scalable system, it also improves fault isolation and enables faster deployment. It's often used in combination with other architectural patterns and styles such as event-driven architecture, CQRS, and service-oriented architecture.
