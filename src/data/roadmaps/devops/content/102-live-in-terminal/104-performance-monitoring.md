# Performance Monitoring

There are many tools available to monitor the performance of your application. Some of the most popular are:

- `nmon` - A system monitor tool for Linux and AIX systems.
- `iostat` - A tool that reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices, partitions and network filesystems.
- `sar` - A system monitor command used to report on various system loads, including CPU activity, memory/paging, device load, network.
- `vmstat` - A tool that reports virtual memory statistics.

Nmon is a fully interactive performance monitoring command-line utility tool for Linux. It is a benchmark tool that displays performance about the cpu, memory, network, disks, file system, nfs, top processes, resources, and power micro-partition.

The iostat command in Linux is used for monitoring system input/output statistics for devices and partitions. It monitors system input/output by observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates. The iostat produce reports may be used to change the system configuration to raised balance the input/output between the physical disks.
