# Per-user, Per-Database Settings

## Per User Per Database Settings

In PostgreSQL, you have the flexibility to configure settings on a per user and per database level. This means you can fine-tune the performance of your system, enhancing scalability and ensuring each user and database is tailored to its specific requirements.

### Why Use Per User Per Database Settings?

There are several reasons you might want to use per user per database settings:

1. **Isolation**: Certain users or databases may have specific requirements that should not affect other users or databases.
2. **Resource Management**: You can allocate resources based on the needs of each user and database. This way, you prevent one user or database from consuming too many resources and ensure optimal performance for all.
3. **Compliance**: In some cases, enforcing specific settings per user or database can be necessary for compliance or regulatory purposes.
4. **Testing**: You can use different settings for testing purposes, for example, while testing new configurations or extensions before rolling them out to the production environment.

### How to Implement Per User Per Database Settings

You can implement per user per database settings by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file or using the `ALTER ROLE` and `ALTER DATABASE` statements. Below, we'll discuss both approaches.

#### Using postgresql.conf

In your `postgresql.conf` file, you can use the `include_dir` directive to include configuration files from a specified directory. For example:

```
include_dir = 'per_db_conf'
```

This will instruct PostgreSQL to load all configuration files from the `per_db_conf` directory. 

You can create separate configuration files for each user and database, with contents like:

```
# for user 'user1'
override_user.user1 = 'user1.conf'

# for database 'db1'
override_db.db1 = 'db1.conf'
```

Where `user1.conf` and `db1.conf` contain the specific settings for the user and database, respectively.

#### Using ALTER ROLE and ALTER DATABASE

You can also set configuration parameters directly for a user or database using the `ALTER ROLE` and `ALTER DATABASE` statements.

For users:

```sql
ALTER ROLE user1 SET search_path = 'public, user1_schema';
ALTER ROLE user1 SET work_mem = '32MB';
```

For databases:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE db1 SET timezone = 'UTC';
ALTER DATABASE db1 SET maintenance_work_mem = '64MB';
```

In this way, you can apply specific settings to each user or database as needed.

### Conclusion

Using per user per database settings is an effective way to manage resources and optimize the performance of your PostgreSQL environment. By taking advantage of this feature, you can ensure a balance between the needs of each user and database, which will provide a better overall experience for all. Remember to test the configurations and monitor their impact on your system to make any necessary adjustments over time.
