# Storage Parameters

## Storage Parameters in PostgreSQL

Storage parameters in PostgreSQL are an essential part of fine-grained tuning, as they allow you to customize the behavior of individual tables and indexes to match the specific requirements of your applications. By tweaking these parameters, you can optimize the read and write operations of your database, significantly improving its performance.

In this section, we will discuss the following storage parameters in detail:

1. `fillfactor`
2. `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`
3. `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`
4. `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`
5. `autovacuum_analyze_cost_limit`
6. `toast_tuple_target`

### 1. fillfactor

`fillfactor` is a percentage value that specifies how much of the table or index pages should be filled with data. By default, the `fillfactor` is set to `100`, meaning that each page is packed with data as much as possible. Lowering the `fillfactor` can provide space for updates, reducing the need for page splits and improving the overall update performance.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET (fillfactor = value);
```

### 2. autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor

`autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor` determines the fraction of the table size that must be outdated before a vacuum operation occurs. By default, this value is set to `0.2` (20%). Decreasing this value will cause vacuum operations to execute more frequently, potentially helping keep the table size in check.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = value);
```

### 3. autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor

`autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor` decides the fraction of the table size that should be outdated before an auto-analyze operation gets triggered. By default, it is set to `0.1` (10%). Adjusting this value will control the frequency of analyze operations.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = value);
```

### 4. autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit

`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit` determines the cost limit for a vacuum operation. A higher value will lead to more prolonged and more aggressive vacuum operations. By default, it is set to `2000`. Adjusting this value will affect the cost-based vacuum delay approach.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = value);
```

### 5. autovacuum_analyze_cost_limit

`autovacuum_analyze_cost_limit` sets a cost limit for analyze operations. Similar to `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`, a higher value will result in more prolonged and more aggressive analyze operations. By default, it is set to `10000`.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name SET (autovacuum_analyze_cost_limit = value);
```

### 6. toast_tuple_target

`toast_tuple_target` specifies the target length of an index in the TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) table. The default value is `2048`. Adjusting this value can help optimize the storage of larger data types, such as `text` and `bytea`.

#### Usage:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET STORAGE PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN;
```

In conclusion, understanding and adjusting storage parameters in PostgreSQL can significantly improve the performance of your database. As a DBA, it's crucial to monitor and fine-tune these parameters according to the specific needs of your application.
