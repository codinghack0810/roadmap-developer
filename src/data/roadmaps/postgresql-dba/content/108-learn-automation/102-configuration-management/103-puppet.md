# Puppet

## Puppet: Configuration Management Tool

Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that helps automate the management of your infrastructure, application delivery, and deployment across network devices, servers, and cloud resources. As a PostgreSQL DBA, you can use Puppet to maintain and configure the desired state of your PostgreSQL environments, handle frequent deployment tasks, and ensure your infrastructure stays consistent and up-to-date throughout its lifecycle.

### Key concepts

- **Manifests**: Written in Puppet's DSL language, manifests are plain text files that describe the desired state of your PostgreSQL environments. These are stored as '.pp' files in Puppet.
- **Resources**: Puppet uses a resource abstraction layer to model system resources, like files, packages, or services in your PostgreSQL environments. Resources can be defined and managed using Puppet manifests.
- **Classes**: A collection of resources and configurations that can be included in nodes or other classes. They define the behavior of your PostgreSQL instances and can be parameterized for flexibility.
- **Modules**: A collection of Puppet manifests, templates, and other files organized in a predefined directory structure. Modules help you manage different parts of your PostgreSQL infrastructure.

### Puppet integration with PostgreSQL

Integrating Puppet with PostgreSQL can help you manage PostgreSQL configurations, monitor databases, automate backups, and handle other critical database administration tasks. Puppet has a rich ecosystem of pre-built modules, and you can make use of these modules that are specifically designed for PostgreSQL management.

#### Example modules
- **puppetlabs/postgresql**: A community-maintained module to manage various aspects of your PostgreSQL installation, such as creating and managing PostgreSQL clusters, databases, users, and extensions.
- **EDB/enterprise-postgresql**: A module for managing EDB Postgres Advanced Server and some of the additional tools provided by EnterpriseDB.

#### Example usage

To demonstrate Puppet with PostgreSQL, let's consider a simple example. We will install and configure a PostgreSQL server using the `puppetlabs/postgresql` module.

1. Install the module:

```bash
puppet module install puppetlabs/postgresql
```

2. Create a manifest file named `postgres.pp`:

```puppet
class { 'postgresql::globals':
  version             => '13',
  manage_package_repo => true,
  encoding            => 'UTF-8',
  locale              => 'en_US.UTF-8',
} ->
class { 'postgresql::server':
  ip_mask_allow_all_users => '0.0.0.0/0',
  manage_firewall         => true,
  
  pg_hba_rules => {
    'allow ipv4' => {
      type        => 'host',
      database    => 'all',
      user        => 'all',
      address     => '0.0.0.0/0',
      auth_method => 'trust',
    }
