# Resources Usage

# Resource Usage in PostgreSQL

Resource usage refers to the management of various resources such as memory, CPU, and disk usage while utilizing PostgreSQL. Effective management of these resources is crucial for achieving optimal performance and ensuring smooth operation of the database. In this section, we will discuss the key configuration parameters related to resource usage in PostgreSQL.

## Memory Usage

PostgreSQL utilizes memory for several purposes such as caching, sorting, and connection handling. To manage memory usage efficiently, we need to focus on the following parameters:

### `shared_buffers`

This configuration parameter determines the amount of memory reserved for shared memory buffers. It is used by all PostgreSQL processes for various purposes, such as caching frequently accessed data. A recommended value is around 25% of the total system memory.

```ini
shared_buffers = 4GB
```

### `work_mem`

`work_mem` sets the amount of memory used per query operation, such as sorting and hashing. Increasing this value allows more memory-intensive tasks to execute efficiently but may consume a lot of memory when executing multiple tasks concurrently. The appropriate value depends on the workload and available memory.

```ini
work_mem = 64MB
```

### `maintenance_work_mem`

This parameter sets the amount of memory used for maintenance tasks like VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE. A higher value speeds up these operations but may consume more memory. 

```ini
maintenance_work_mem = 256MB
```

## CPU Usage

PostgreSQL uses the CPU for executing queries and performing maintenance tasks. The key configuration parameter related to CPU usage is:

### `max_parallel_workers`

This parameter determines the maximum number of parallel workers that can be active concurrently. Parallel query execution can significantly speed up the processing time for large and complex queries by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

```ini
max_parallel_workers = 4
```

## Disk Usage

PostgreSQL stores data and indexes on the disk. Efficient management of the disk space significantly affects the database's performance. The important parameters related to disk usage include:

### `default_statistics_target`

This parameter sets the default sample size for statistics collection by the ANALYZE command. A higher value can lead to more accurate query plans, but at the cost of increased disk space usage.

```ini
default_statistics_target = 50
```

### `checkpoint_timeout` and `max_wal_size`

The Write Ahead Log (WAL) records changes to the database and is used for recovery in case of a crash. `checkpoint_timeout` sets the frequency of checkpoints, while `max_wal_size` controls the maximum size of the WAL files.

```ini
checkpoint_timeout = 5min
max_wal_size = 2GB
```

These are just a few of the critical parameters you can configure to optimize the resource usage in PostgreSQL. Keep in mind that every workload is unique, and it is important to monitor and understand your database's performance to adjust the settings accordingly.
