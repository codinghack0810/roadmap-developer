# Reporting Logging and Statistics

## Reporting Logging Statistics

In this section, we will discuss how to configure PostgreSQL to report and log various statistics. These statistics can be incredibly valuable for monitoring and optimization purposes, especially for database administrators (DBA) who are responsible for managing and maintaining the database system.

### Why Log Statistics

Logging statistics help DBAs to:

1. Identify performance issues and potential bottlenecks.
2. Monitor the overall health of the system.
3. Plan for capacity or hardware upgrades.
4. Debug and optimize queries.
5. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, such as auditing.

### Configuration Parameters

PostgreSQL offers several configuration parameters that allow you to control the reporting and logging of statistics. These are typically set in the `postgresql.conf` file, and they can be modified even while the server is running using the `ALTER SYSTEM` command.

Here are some key parameters to consider:

- `log_statement_stats`: When enabled (set to 'on'), this parameter logs the performance statistics for each executed statement. Useful in debugging slow queries.

- `log_parser_stats`, `log_planner_stats`, `log_executor_stats`: These parameters enable more detailed logging of various subsystems within the PostgreSQL engine.

- `log_duration`: When enabled (set to 'on'), this parameter logs the duration of each executed statement. This information can be useful for identifying slow queries.

- `log_min_duration_statement`: Specifies the minimum duration (in milliseconds) of a statement to be logged. Only statements with an execution time equal to or greater than this value will be logged. This is useful for filtering out less significant queries.

- `log_checkpoints`: When enabled (set to 'on'), this parameter logs information about checkpoint events. These events are a part of PostgreSQL's write-ahead logging (WAL) mechanism and can affect performance in specific scenarios.

- `log_connections` and `log_disconnections`: These parameters log any new connections and disconnections to/from the PostgreSQL server, which helps to monitor access patterns and detect possible security issues.

### Example:

Here's an example of how to configure the `postgresql.conf` file to log statement statistics and durations:

```
log_statement_stats = on
log_duration = on
log_min_duration_statement = 100
```

This configuration will log the statistics for all queries that take 100 milliseconds or more to execute, along with their duration.

### Analyzing Logged Statistics

Once the appropriate statistics are being logged, you can use various external tools to analyze these logs and gather insights. Some popular tools include [pgBadger](https://github.com/darold/pgbadger), [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html), and [pganalyze](https://pganalyze.com/).

By regularly monitoring and analyzing your PostgreSQL logs, you'll be better equipped to manage your database system efficiently and effectively.
