# Vacuums

## Vacuuming in PostgreSQL

Vacuuming is an essential housekeeping process in PostgreSQL that helps maintain the overall health and performance of the database. By design, PostgreSQL is a Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) system, which means that each transaction works with a snapshot of the database at a certain point in time. As a result, when a row is updated or deleted, a new version of the row is created, while the old version remains. This increases the size of the database and can lead to performance issues over time. Vacuuming reclaims storage occupied by dead rows and optimizes the performance of queries and the database as a whole.

In this section, we will discuss different types of vacuuming processes and how to configure them effectively in PostgreSQL.

### Types of Vacuuming Processes

There are three main types of vacuuming processes in PostgreSQL:

1. **Standard Vacuum:** This process reclaims storage space and optimizes the database by removing dead rows and updating internal statistics. It does not require any additional parameters and is invoked by the `VACUUM` command.

2. **Full Vacuum:** This is a more aggressive and time-consuming version of the standard vacuum. It reclaims more storage space by compacting the table, but it may also lock the table during the process. This can be invoked by the `VACUUM FULL` command.

3. **Analyze:** This process updates internal statistics about the distribution of rows and the size of the tables to optimize query planning. It does not free any storage space. This can be invoked by the `ANALYZE` command.

### Configuring Vacuuming in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has an automatic background process called the "autovacuum" that takes care of standard vacuuming and analyzing operations. By default, the autovacuum is enabled, and it's recommended to keep it that way. However, it's essential to fine-tune its configuration for optimal performance. Here are some key configuration parameters related to vacuuming:

- `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`: This parameter determines the fraction of the table size that must no longer be useful (dead rows) before the table is vacuumed. The default value is `0.2`, meaning 20% of the table must be dead rows before the table is vacuumed.

- `autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`: This parameter determines the fraction of the table size that must change (inserts, updates, or deletes) before the table is analyzed. The default value is `0.1`, meaning at least 10% of the table must have changed before the table is analyzed.

- `maintenance_work_mem`: This parameter determines the amount of memory available for maintenance tasks like vacuuming. Increasing this value can speed up the vacuuming process. The default value is `64 MB`.

- `vacuum_cost_limit`: This parameter is used by the cost-based vacuum delay feature, which can slow down the vacuuming process to reduce the impact on the overall performance of the system. The default value is `200`.

Remember that these parameter values should be adjusted based on your system's hardware, workload, and specific requirements.

### Monitoring Vacuum Activity

You can monitor the vacuuming activities in your PostgreSQL database through the `pg_stat_user_tables` and `pg_stat_bgwriter` views. These views provide insights into the number of vacuum and analyze operations performed on each table and the overall effectiveness of the vacuuming process.

In conclusion, vacuuming is a critical aspect of PostgreSQL administration that helps to clean up dead rows, update internal statistics, and optimize the database engine for better performance. As a PostgreSQL DBA, it's essential to understand the various types of vacuums, configure them appropriately, and monitor their activities. With proper vacuuming settings, you can achieve a more efficient and high-performing PostgreSQL database.
