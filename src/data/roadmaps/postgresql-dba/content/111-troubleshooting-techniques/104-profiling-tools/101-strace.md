# strace

## Strace

`strace` is a powerful diagnostic tool that allows you to trace system calls and signals made by a running process. This tool can be very useful for PostgreSQL DBAs to investigate performance bottlenecks, identify and resolve issues related to system call errors, and optimize various aspects of the PostgreSQL database.

### Key Features

- **System call tracing**: `strace` can log the system calls made by a process along with their arguments, return values, and execution time. This information can be vital to pinpoint issues in PostgreSQL or its extensions.
- **Signal tracing**: The tool can trace and log signals received by a process as well. This becomes particularly useful in cases like process termination or contention situations.
- **Count mode**: `strace` provides an option to display a summary of counts and time spent on each system call instead of the full trace output. This can help DBAs to identify bottlenecks and take necessary optimization steps.

### Usage Examples

To use `strace` for profiling a PostgreSQL server, follow these examples:

1.  Attach `strace` to a running PostgreSQL process:

```sh
strace -p <pid>
```

Replace `<pid>` with the process ID of the PostgreSQL server you want to examine.

2. Collect the output of `strace` in a file for further analysis:

```sh
strace -p <pid> -o output_file
```

3. Trace a specific system call, for example to trace only `read` and `write` system calls:

```sh
strace -e trace=read,write -p <pid>
```

4. Summarize counts and time spent for each system call:

```sh
strace -c -p <pid>
```

### Limitations

`strace` comes with certain limitations as well:

- It may generate a significant amount of output that needs to be parsed and analyzed, which can be time-consuming.
- Running `strace` can come with a performance overhead, thereby causing additional latency on the process being monitored.

Despite these limitations, `strace` remains a powerful and effective tool for PostgreSQL DBAs to get insights into system-level interactions and performance issues.
