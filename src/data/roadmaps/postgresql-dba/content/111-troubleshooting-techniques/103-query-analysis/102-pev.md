# Pev - A PostgreSQL Explain Visualizer

As you delve deeper into query analysis, it becomes important to understand and visualize the execution plans of your queries. One highly recommended tool for this purpose is `pev`, short for **PostgreSQL Explain Visualizer**.

Pev is an open-source, web-based platform that takes the output of the `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command and turns it into an intuitive and interactive graphical representation, allowing you to better understand and optimize query performance.

## Features
- Color-coded nodes for intuitive understanding of scan types and costs
- Detailed information on each node with metrics like duration, loops, cost, and rows
- Zoom in and out for easy navigation through complex plans
- Supports various output formats (JSON, YAML, and XML)

## Using Pev

In order to use Pev, follow these steps:

- Run your query with the `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command in PostgreSQL to generate the query execution plan.
   
   ```
   EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = 1;
   ```

- Copy the resulting JSON output.

- Head to the [Pev online visualizer](https://tatiyants.com/pev/) (or a [local instance](https://github.com/AlexTatiyants/pev) if you prefer) and paste the JSON output into the text box.

- Pev will automatically generate an interactive, graphical representation of your query's execution plan to better comprehend the query's cost breakdown and any potential bottlenecks.

## Example:

Here's a sample of how Pev represents an execution plan. Note the easily distinguishable scan types with color-coding, and how the tooltips provide additional details when hovering over nodes.

## Summary

In conclusion, Pev is an essential tool for any PostgreSQL developer looking to analyze and optimize their queries. By providing a clear visual representation of query execution plans, it enables you to quickly spot areas of improvement and ensure the overall efficiency of your database operations.
