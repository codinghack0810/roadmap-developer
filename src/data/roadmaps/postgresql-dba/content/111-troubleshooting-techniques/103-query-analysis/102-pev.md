# PEV

## Pev: PostgreSQL Explain Visualizer

Pev is a powerful tool that helps in query analysis by providing a visual representation of the `EXPLAIN` output for your PostgreSQL queries. This helps database administrators (DBAs) and developers to better understand the query optimizer's decisions while executing the SQL query, allowing them to identify performance issues and optimize the queries accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Pev provides an easy-to-understand graphical representation of the query execution plan, illustrating the flow of data between various operations.
- **Node Details**: By hovering over or clicking on a node in the visualization, you can see detailed information about the node, such as the table being scanned, the filter applied, and the cost estimates.
- **Support for Different Explain Formats**: Pev can parse and visualize output generated with various `EXPLAIN` options, such as `EXPLAIN VERBOSE`, `EXPLAIN COSTS`, and `EXPLAIN BUFFERS`.
- **Support for All Major PostgreSQL Versions**: Pev works with all major versions of PostgreSQL, ensuring compatibility with the changes in `EXPLAIN` output between versions.
- **Portability**: Pev can be used as a standalone application or embedded in a web application to visualize query plans directly.

### How to Use Pev

1. Obtain the `EXPLAIN` output from your PostgreSQL query by running `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) your_query;`.
2. Visit the [Pev online tool](https://tatiyants.com/pev/) or download the [standalone version](https://github.com/dalibo/pev).
3. Paste the JSON-formatted `EXPLAIN` output into the input box, and Pev will generate and display the visual representation of the query execution plan.
4. Analyze the generated visualization to identify areas of potential optimization and bottlenecks.

### Tips for query analysis using Pev

- Pay attention to nodes with high-cost estimates, as they may represent opportunities for optimization.
- Look for table scans (Sequential Scan) on large tables, as they may be an indication of missing or inefficient indexes.
- Use the detailed information shown for each node to get a better understanding of the query execution and identify potential issues.
- In addition to Pev, make use of the other monitoring and diagnostic tools available for PostgreSQL, such as `pg_stat_statements` and `auto_explain`.

By incorporating Pev into your query analysis workflow, you'll be better equipped to understand, optimize, and troubleshoot your PostgreSQL queries, ultimately leading to improved database performance.
