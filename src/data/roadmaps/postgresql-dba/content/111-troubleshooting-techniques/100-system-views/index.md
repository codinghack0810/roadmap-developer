# Postgres System Views

## System Views

**System Views** in PostgreSQL are predefined schema tables that provide information about the database system catalogs. They act as a window into the internal workings of the PostgreSQL database engine, enabling you to gather valuable information for troubleshooting and performance tuning.

System views are essentially a user-friendly interface built on top of system catalogs. They simplify the process of querying the catalogs, allowing you to interact with them easily.

### Types of System Views

PostgreSQL provides two types of system views:

1. **Information Schema (information_schema):** This is a collection of views that provide an SQL-standard compliant view of the metadata of the database. It includes details about tables, columns, data types, constraints, and more. The Information Schema is designed to be portable across different relational database management systems (RDBMS).

2. **PostgreSQL System Catalogs (pg_catalog):** These are a set of views specific to PostgreSQL, which provide additional information about the database, beyond what is available in the Information Schema. The PostgreSQL System Catalogs include details about database objects, system settings, and configuration parameters.

### Using System Views

To access information from system views, you can simply run SQL queries on them. Below are some examples:

- To list all tables in the current database:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  ```

- To list all columns of a specific table:

  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'your_table_name';
  ```

- To retrieve a list of active database connections:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
  ```

- To view the configuration settings for the current database:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_settings;
  ```

### Troubleshooting Techniques

System views may contain a wealth of information that can help you troubleshoot various database-related issues, such as:

- Identifying locks and blocked transactions
- Analyzing and optimizing slow-running queries
- Monitoring and adjusting database resources
- Investigating schema and data inconsistencies

In conclusion, using system views in PostgreSQL is an invaluable method of accessing internal information for troubleshooting and performance tuning. By leveraging these views, you can efficiently analyze and maintain your database system.
