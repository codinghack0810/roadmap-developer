# Golden Signals

## Golden Signals

Golden signals are a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) used to monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot the health or performance of a system, such as a PostgreSQL database. These signals, originally defined by Google in the context of monitoring distributed systems, provide a high-level overview of a system's performance and help identify potential bottlenecks, issues, or anomalies. These indicators are essential for effective management of PostgreSQL databases and they are a crucial aspect of troubleshooting methods.

The four primary golden signals for PostgreSQL databases are:

1. **Latency**: The time taken by a request to complete or the response time for a query or transaction. High latency may indicate issues in the network, slow server response, or a bottleneck within the database. Monitoring and diagnosing latency issues can help improve the performance and responsiveness of a PostgreSQL database.

2. **Traffic**: The total number of requests or workload arriving at the database server. High or unexpected levels of traffic can lead to increased resource consumption or contention, impacting overall responsiveness and performance. Careful monitoring of traffic enables proactive capacity planning, ensuring consistent performance during periods of high demand.

3. **Errors**: The rate at which requests or queries fail, either due to system issues, incorrect input data or application bugs. An increase in errors can disrupt normal application functionality, leading to degraded user experience or data integrity issues. Monitoring error rates closely and identifying patterns or trends can help quickly diagnose and fix underlying problems.

4. **Saturation**: The utilization of system resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) due to the current workload. Saturation is often the leading cause of performance bottlenecks, which can result in slow response times, increased latencies, or even complete system failure. By monitoring saturation levels, you can identify potential issues before they become critical, making it easier to execute capacity planning and optimize resource allocation.

In conclusion, the golden signals of latency, traffic, errors, and saturation provide a powerful framework for monitoring and troubleshooting PostgreSQL databases. By regularly checking and optimizing these key performance indicators, you can maintain a healthy and high-performing database environment, ensuring reliable application performance and data integrity.
