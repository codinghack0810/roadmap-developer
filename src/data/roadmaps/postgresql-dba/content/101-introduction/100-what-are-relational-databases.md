# What are Relational Databases?

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that store structured data in tables. This type of database organization allows users to efficiently access, manipulate, and search for data within the system. The term "relational" refers to the manner in which the data is stored â€“ as a collection of related tables.

### Structure of Relational Databases

The main building blocks of any relational database are:

1. **Tables**: Each table represents a specific entity or object and is organized into rows and columns. Rows (also known as records or tuples) represent individual instances of the entity, while columns (also known as fields or attributes) represent attributes or properties of each instance.

2. **Keys**: To uniquely identify and relate tables, relational databases use a combination of primary keys and foreign keys. A primary key is a unique identifier within a table, while a foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.

3. **Schema**: The schema is the blueprint or structure of the database. It defines how the tables, keys, and relationships between tables are organized.

### Basic Operations in Relational Databases

The basic operations that can be performed in relational databases include:

1. **Create**: This is the process of defining the structure and characteristics of a new table or object within the database.

2. **Query**: Querying is the operation of retrieving specific data from the tables in the database, typically using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL allows users to retrieve, filter, sort, and manipulate data based on specific criteria.

3. **Update**: Updating involves modifying the data stored in the database, such as adding new records, changing values, or deleting records.

4. **Delete**: This operation allows users to remove specific records from the database.

### Key Advantages of Relational Databases

Some of the most notable advantages of using relational databases include:

1. **Structured data organization**: The row and column organization allows for easy retrieval of specific data based on specified criteria.

2. **Data consistency**: The use of primary and foreign keys enforces relationships between tables, ensuring data integrity.

3. **Flexibility**: Relational databases allow users to create complex queries and report structures, which are essential for data extraction and analysis.

4. **Scalability**: They can handle large amounts of data and can be expanded to meet the growing needs of an organization.

5. **Security**: Relational databases provide a wide range of security features to ensure that sensitive data is protected and only accessible by authorized users.

In summary, relational databases provide a powerful and flexible way to store and manage structured data. Throughout this guide, we will further explore PostgreSQL, an advanced open-source relational database management system, and dive into the best practices for efficient database administration.
