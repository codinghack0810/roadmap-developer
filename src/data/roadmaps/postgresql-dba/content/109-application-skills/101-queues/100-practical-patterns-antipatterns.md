# Practical Patterns and Antipatterns on Queues

In this section, we will discuss practical patterns and antipatterns for working with queues in PostgreSQL. These concepts are important to understand in order to optimize and manage your queues efficiently.

## Patterns

### 1. Using LISTEN/NOTIFY

PostgreSQL has an interprocess communication (IPC) feature called `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY`, which allows clients or applications to subscribe to the database events. This can be used to create a lightweight pub-sub mechanism for handling queued tasks efficiently. Clients can `LISTEN` for events, while other parts of the system `NOTIFY` when new tasks are added to the queue. Here is an example implementation:

```sql
-- Create a channel for communication
LISTEN my_channel;

-- Emit a notification on the channel when there is a queued task
NOTIFY my_channel, 'New task in the queue';

-- Listen for events in the application and consume queued tasks
-- some_application_code_here
```

### 2. Prioritizing Queued Tasks

When handling a queue of tasks in your PostgreSQL, it can be useful to prioritize these tasks based on certain attributes like importance or due dates. In such cases, use the `ORDER BY` clause in your queries to order the tasks based on priority. This can significantly improve the behavior of your queues and make them more responsive.

```sql
-- Fetch top-priority tasks from the queue
SELECT *
FROM task_queue
WHERE status='queued'
ORDER BY priority DESC, due_date ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Antipatterns

### 1. Polling for Pending Tasks

A common antipattern when working with queues is polling the database for new or pending tasks in a loop. This approach can put unnecessary strain on your PostgreSQL, as the constant repetition of read queries can lead to increased load and diminished performance. Instead, consider using the aforementioned `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` pattern, which reduces the need for constant polling of the database and improves efficiency.

### 2. Using Queue as a Store of Everything

Another antipattern is using a queue as a storage for every task in the system, including those completed or in progress, which can cause performance issues due to the high number of rows in the queue table. Instead, use separate tables to store completed tasks and tasks in progress. This can lead to better separation of concerns, improving overall performance and database management.

```sql
-- Move completed tasks to a separate table
INSERT INTO completed_tasks
SELECT *
FROM task_queue
WHERE status = 'completed';

DELETE FROM task_queue
WHERE status = 'completed';
```

By being aware of these patterns and antipatterns, you will be better equipped to efficiently work with queues in PostgreSQL. Applying these best practices will ensure smoother performance and improved database management.
