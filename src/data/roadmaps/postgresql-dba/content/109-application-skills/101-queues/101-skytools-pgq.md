# SkyTools PGQ: A Brief Summary

SkyTools is a collection of utilities, tools, and libraries for PostgreSQL, and PGQ (PostgreSQL Queue) is a part of SkyTools designed for queuing and processing large numbers of events in a performant and reliable manner. PGQ provides efficient, transactional queuing mechanism for PostgreSQL databases, allowing multiple queue consumers with different processing requirements to work concurrently.

## Key Features

- **Event-based processing**: PGQ allows the creation of events that can be queued and processed by subscribers.
- **Multiple queues**: It's possible to create multiple PGQ queues in a single database to handle different event types or to segregate event processing.
- **Load management**: Through batching, PGQ can accumulate events in the queue before sending them to the queue consumers, reducing overall system load and improving performance.
- **Transactional consistency**: PGQ ensures that events are only removed from the queue once they have been successfully processed by all attached consumers, thus avoiding data loss or inconsistency.
- **Failover support**: In case of a failure, PGQ can be set up for automatic failover to a standby server, ensuring high availability of the queuing system.

## PGQ Components

Below are the main components in the PGQ ecosystem:

1. **Producer**: The event generator which inserts events into the queue.
2. **Queue**: This is where the events are stored in a reliable and transactional manner.
3. **Ticker**: A background process that manages and maintains the queue.
4. **Consumer**: The processing agent that subscribes to the queue, receives events, and performs required actions.

## Getting Started

To get started with SkyTools PGQ, you will need to install the SkyTools package and follow these basic steps:

1. **Create a database**: Create a new PostgreSQL database or use an existing one to store the PGQ schema and tables.
2. **Install the PGQ extension**: Run the SQL scripts provided by the SkyTools package to set up the necessary tables and functions for PGQ.
3. **Configure the ticker**: Set up the configuration file for the pgqadm ticker program and start the ticker process.
4. **Create queues**: Use the PGQ API or utility scripts to create one or more queue(s) in the configured database.
5. **Create consumers**: Implement your custom event processing logic as consumers and register them to the appropriate queue(s).
6. **Produce events**: Insert events into the queue using the PGQ API or utility scripts.
7. **Start the consumers**: Finally, start your queue consumer processes to begin processing the events in the queue.

By implementing SkyTools PGQ in your PostgreSQL environment, you can efficiently process large volumes of events and ensure data consistency and reliability across multiple consumers.
