# Data Partitioning and Sharding Patterns

In this section, we will discuss data partitioning and sharding patterns in PostgreSQL. When dealing with big datasets or high-throughput applications, it is essential to distribute the data across multiple databases or servers to achieve better performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## Data Partitioning

Data partitioning is a technique that divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Each partition is a smaller table that stores a subset of the data, usually based on specific criteria such as ranges, lists, or hashes. Partitioning can improve query performance, simplifies data maintenance tasks, and optimizes resource utilization.

PostgreSQL supports different partitioning methods, such as:

- **Range Partitioning:** The data in a range-partitioned table is separated into partitions based on a specified range of values for a given column. For example, orders could be partitioned by date range, with each partition containing orders within a specific date interval.

- **List Partitioning:** The data in a list-partitioned table is separated into partitions based on specified discrete sets of values for a given column. For example, customers could be partitioned by their country, with each partition storing customers from a specific country.

- **Hash Partitioning:** The data in a hash-partitioned table is divided into partitions using a hash function applied to one or more columns. This method distributes data uniformly across all partitions, which helps in load balancing and parallel query processing. For example, products could be hash partitioned based on the product ID.

For more information on partitioning in PostgreSQL, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-partitioning.html).

## Sharding

Sharding is a technique that splits a large dataset across multiple database instances or servers, called shards. Each shard is an independent and self-contained unit that holds a portion of the overall data, and shards can be distributed across different geographical locations or infrastructures.

In PostgreSQL environment, sharding can be achieved in different ways:

- **Sharding at the application level:** The application defines the logic to decide which shard will store a specific data record. The application communicates directly with each shard for querying or modifying the data.

- **Sharding using foreign data wrappers:** PostgreSQL provides a feature called foreign data wrappers (FDW) that allows a PostgreSQL server to access data stored in remote servers, treating them as local tables. By using this technique, the data can be sharded across multiple remote servers, and the local PostgreSQL instance acts as a coordinator for accessing these shards.

- **Sharding using 3rd-party tools:** Several 3rd-party tools, such as Pgpool-II, Citus, and PLProxy, can be used for sharding purpose. These tools handle connection pooling, load balancing, and data distribution across multiple PostgreSQL instances. The choice of tools depends on the requirements, complexity, and the desired level of control over the sharding logic.

Implementing data partitioning or sharding requires careful planning and analysis of data distribution, query patterns, and system resources. Balancing the trade-offs of manageability, performance, and scalability is crucial for a successful implementation.
