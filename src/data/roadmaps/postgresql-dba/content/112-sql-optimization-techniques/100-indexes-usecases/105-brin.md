# BRIN

## BRIN (Block Range INdex)

BRIN stands for Block Range INdex, which is an index type introduced in PostgreSQL 9.5 to optimize the performance of large tables containing a significant amount of data. BRIN is particularly useful for large-scale data warehousing and analytics applications where data is stored sequentially and accessed in a range or sorted manner.

### Benefits:

1. Space efficient: BRIN indexes consume significantly less space compared to other index types like btree, since they store only summary information about each block range.
2. Fast index creation: Since BRIN indexes only store information about a small fraction of the rows in a table, creating a BRIN index is significantly faster than creating a btree or hash index.
3. Range queries: BRIN indexes are especially efficient for range-based queries, such as aggregation and analytics queries.

### Limitations:

1. Best suited for large tables: For small tables, traditional btree or hash indexes may provide better performance.
2. Sequential or sorted data: BRIN indexes perform optimally on columns where data is stored in a sequential or sorted manner. For example, a timestamp or an auto-incrementing integer column.
3. Update performance: BRIN indexes have slower update performance compared to other index types, so they may not be ideal for tables with a high volume of updates or deletions.

### Usage:

To create a BRIN index, use the `USING brin` clause while creating the index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX my_brin_index ON my_large_table USING brin (column_name);
```

You can also control the granularity of the BRIN index using the `pages_per_range` storage parameter, which defines the number of pages per range-entry in the index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX my_custom_brin_index ON my_large_table USING brin (column_name) WITH (pages_per_range = 128);
```

### Conclusion:

When dealing with large tables having sequential or sorted data, consider using a BRIN index for improved performance and storage efficiency, particularly for range-based queries. However, be cautious of the update performance and the need for sequential data to achieve optimal results.
