# SELinux

## Summary: SELinux

In this section, we will discuss **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux), a mandatory access control (MAC) security subsystem in the Linux kernel that enhances the overall security of a system. It is crucial for PostgreSQL DBAs to be familiar with SELinux, as it adds an extra layer of protection to the data.

### Introduction to SELinux

SELinux is a security enhancement module integrated into the Linux kernel, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). This security module implements MAC policies through the power of the Linux kernel, allowing you to define fine-grained access controls for various system entities such as users, files, applications, and network ports.

### SELinux with PostgreSQL

SELinux offers great value to PostgreSQL DBAs, as it ensures the protection of your valuable database in the event of an intrusion or misconfiguration. By default, SELinux policies are already configured for PostgreSQL with tight security and can be found in the SELinux policy package.

The policies work by confining the PostgreSQL process to a separate security context, allowing for the fine-grained customization of access rights. This means that even if an attacker exploits the PostgreSQL process, they will be limited to the access restrictions set by the SELinux policy, thus preventing further system compromise.

### Configuring SELinux for PostgreSQL

SELinux operates in three states:

1. Enforcing: SELinux is enabled and enforces its policies.
2. Permissive: SELinux is enabled, but merely logs policy violations and does not enforce them.
3. Disabled: SELinux is completely disabled.

To check the current state and mode of SELinux, use the following command:

```bash
sestatus
```

Ideally, you should have SELinux in the enforcing mode for optimal security. If you need to change the state or mode of SELinux, edit the `/etc/selinux/config` file and restart your system.

Some useful SELinux commands and tools for troubleshooting or configuring policies include:

- `ausearch`: Search and generate reports based on SELinux logs.
- `audit2allow`: Generate SELinux policy rules from log entries.
- `semanage`: Configure SELinux policies and manage different components.
- `sealert`: Analyze log events and suggest possible solutions.

### Conclusion

As a PostgreSQL DBA, understanding and properly configuring SELinux is crucial to maintain the security of your database systems. Take the time to learn more about SELinux and its policies to ensure that your PostgreSQL databases are well-protected.
