# Learn SQL Concepts

In this chapter, we will discuss essential SQL concepts that every PostgreSQL Database Administrator (DBA) should be familiar with. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively managing, querying, and maintaining your databases.

## SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is a domain-specific language designed for managing data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete records in your databases, as well as define and manage the schema and data access patterns.

## Tables

Tables are the fundamental components of a relational database. They consist of rows and columns, with each row representing an individual record and columns representing the attributes (fields) of those records.

- **Table Schema**: The structure and constraints of a table, including column names, data types, and any constraints or indexes.

- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row in a table, generally comprising one or more columns. A primary key ensures that no two records can have the same identifier and guarantees referential integrity for related tables.

- **Foreign Key**: A column (or set of columns) that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing relationships between the two tables and aiding in data consistency and integrity.

## Queries

Queries in SQL are used to extract and manipulate data stored in databases. The most common operations include:

- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from one or more tables or views according to specified criteria.

- **INSERT**: Add a new record or records to a table.

- **UPDATE**: Modify existing records in a table based on specified criteria.

- **DELETE**: Remove records from a table based on specified criteria.

## Joins

Joins are a way of combining rows from two or more tables by matching columns between them. This is done to assemble data from different tables into a single result set.

- **Inner Join**: Returns rows from both tables that have matching column values.

- **Left Join**: Returns all rows from the left table and any matching rows from the right table, filling in missing values with NULL.

- **Right Join**: Returns all rows from the right table and any matching rows from the left table, filling in missing values with NULL.

- **Full Outer Join**: Returns all rows from both tables when there is a match, and fills in missing values with NULL when no match is found.

## Transactions

Transactions are a sequence of operations that follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties, ensuring that your database remains in a consistent state even when multiple users are concurrently executing queries.

- **Atomicity**: Either all operations in a transaction are executed or none are.

- **Consistency**: After a transaction has been completed, the database will remain in a consistent state.

- **Isolation**: Each transaction is isolated from others, so their execution does not affect other transactions' results.

- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its changes persist in the database, even in the event of system failures.

By understanding these core SQL concepts, you will be better equipped to manage and maintain your PostgreSQL databases effectively. In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into each concept and discuss best practices and tips for optimizing your database's performance.
