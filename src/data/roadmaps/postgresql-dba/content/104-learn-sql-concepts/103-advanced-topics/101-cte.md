# CTE

## Common Table Expressions (CTE)

Common Table Expressions (CTE), also known as WITH queries, provide a way to define temporary result sets, that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs are quite useful when working with hierarchical or recursive queries, and they greatly improve the readability and maintainability of complex queries.

### Basic Syntax

A CTE is defined using the `WITH` keyword, followed by the CTE name, an optional column list, and the query that defines the CTE. The CTE is then referenced in the main query.

Here's a basic example:

```
WITH my_cte (column1, column2)
AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM my_table
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT *
FROM my_cte;
```

### Recursive CTEs

One of the most powerful features of CTEs is their ability to work with recursive queries. A recursive CTE consists of two parts - an initial "anchor" query and a "recursive" query that refers back to the CTE.

For example, assume we have a table `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `manager_id`, and we want to find the hierarchy of employees and their managers:

```
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy (id, name, manager_id, level)
AS (
    -- Anchor query
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
    -- Recursive query
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.id
)
SELECT *
FROM hierarchy
ORDER BY level, manager_id;
```

This query starts with the root employees with no manager (level 1), and then recursively adds employees that report to the previously found employees, incrementing the `level` for each iteration.

### Benefits of CTE

1. **Readability and maintainability**: CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
2. **Reusable subqueries**: CTEs can be referenced multiple times within the main query, which helps to avoid duplicating complex subqueries.
3. **Recursive queries**: As demonstrated above, CTEs provide a neat way of working with recursive datasets and hierarchical structures.

In conclusion, Common Table Expressions (CTE) are a valuable tool for PostgreSQL DBAs, providing improved query readability, maintainability, and support for advanced use-cases such as recursive queries.
