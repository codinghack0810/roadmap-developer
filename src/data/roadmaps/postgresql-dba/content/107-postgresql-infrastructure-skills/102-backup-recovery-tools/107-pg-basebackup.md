# Pg_basebackup

`pg_basebackup` is a utility that allows you to take a base backup of your PostgreSQL database cluster. It is a standalone tool that can create a consistent snapshot of the entire PostgreSQL database file system. The output of the command is a binary copy of the directories and files which are required to start a standalone PostgreSQL instance.

## Features

* Generates a full backup of the database cluster
* Supports compression for the backup output
* Allows connection to the database server using a replication connection
* Supports parallelizing and streaming the backups
* Ability to include or exclude specific tablespaces in the backup
* Offers support for various backup output formats such as tar, directory, and plain

## Usage

```
pg_basebackup [OPTIONS]...
```

### Common Options

* `-D`, `--pgdata=DIR` : Specifies the directory where the output will be saved.
* `-F`, `--format=FORMAT` : Specifies the output format. Possible values are `tar`, `plain`, and `directory`. The default is `plain`.
* `-X`, `--xlog-method=FETCH|MULTIPLEX` : Selects the method to fetch Write-Ahead Logs (WAL). `FETCH` (default) fetches the log together with the final checkpoint, while `MULTIPLEX` allows parallel backup and WAL streaming.
* `-P`, `--progress` : Shows progress information during the backup.
* `-z`, `--gzip` : Compresses the tar output with gzip.
* `-Z`, `--compress=VALUE` : Compresses the tar output with gzip at the specified compression level (0 - 9).

## Examples

1. Taking a full base backup of the database cluster:

```bash
pg_basebackup -D /path/to/output
```

2. Taking a base backup in tar format with gzip compression:

```bash
pg_basebackup -D /path/to/output -F tar -z
```

3. Taking a base backup in directory format with progress information:

```bash
pg_basebackup -D /path/to/output -F directory -P
```

## Considerations

Remember that taking a base backup could result in a substantial amount of disk space and I/O activity. It is essential to plan and schedule these backups during periods of reduced database activity if possible. Furthermore, plan for disk space requirements when generating backups, especially when using compression options.

`pg_basebackup` serves as an excellent starting point for implementing backup and recovery strategies in PostgreSQL, as it provides a consistent snapshot of the database cluster. However, it is crucial to complement base backups with regular WAL archiving and additional recovery techniques to ensure optimal database protection.
