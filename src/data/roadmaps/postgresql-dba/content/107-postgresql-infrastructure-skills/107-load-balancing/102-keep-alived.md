# KeepAlived

### Keepalived

**Keepalived** is an open-source software that provides high-availability and load balancing for Linux-based systems. It is widely used to ensure high uptime for various services, including PostgreSQL databases.

In the context of PostgreSQL load balancing, Keepalived plays a crucial role in managing a **Virtual IP Address (VIP)**. The VIP is a single IP address that redirects traffic to one or more PostgreSQL instances. This helps to utilize available resources, ensuring that all instances can serve read or write queries equally.

#### How Keepalived Works

Keepalived uses the **Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)**, which allows routing to the master server and one or more backup servers, based on health checks. If the master server fails or goes down, VRRP promptly switches the VIP to one of the backup servers. This ensures minimal downtime, even during unexpected outages.

#### Key Features of Keepalived

1. **High Availability**: Keepalived ensures seamless failover between master and backup servers, providing high uptime and minimizing service outage.

2. **Load Balancing**: In conjunction with other tools such as PgBouncer, Keepalived can distribute read and write queries across different PostgreSQL instances, optimizing resource usage.

3. **Health Checks**: Keepalived regularly monitors the health of PostgreSQL instances, ensuring the VIP is always pointing to an available server.

4. **Configurable**: Keepalived allows configuring specific parameters such as health check frequency, VIP assignment, and more, making it a flexible solution for various use cases.

#### Basic Setup

To set up Keepalived for load balancing in a PostgreSQL environment, follow these basic steps:

1. Install Keepalived on each PostgreSQL server, including the master and any read replicas or standby servers.

2. Configure Keepalived on each server, specifying the VIP, VRRP instance, and the desired master and backup roles.

3. Set up any necessary health checks or monitoring scripts, ensuring each PostgreSQL instance is properly monitored by Keepalived.

4. Start Keepalived on each server and ensure the VIP is correctly assigned to the master server.

5. Configure your client applications or connection poolers (e.g., PgBouncer) to use the VIP for connecting to PostgreSQL.

By using Keepalived, you can provide a highly available and load balanced PostgreSQL environment, ensuring optimal performance and uptime for your database applications.
