# PgBouncer

# PgBouncer

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL databases. Its main function is to reduce the performance overhead caused by opening new connections to the database by reusing existing connections. This is especially important for applications with a high number of concurrent connections, as PostgreSQL's performance can degrade with too many connections.

## Features

- **Connection pooling**: PgBouncer maintains a pool of active connections and efficiently assigns these connections to incoming client requests, minimizing the overhead of establishing new connections.
- **Transaction pooling**: In this mode, clients can only run a single transaction at a time, but connection reuse is maximized, which can greatly improve performance in scenarios with high levels of concurrency.
- **Statement pooling**: This mode only pools connections that are outside of a transaction, allowing clients to run multiple transactions in parallel while still improving connection reuse.
- **Session pooling**: Each client connection is directly mapped to a dedicated PostgreSQL connection, though unused connections are still returned to the pool for use by other clients.
- **TLS/SSL support**: PgBouncer supports encrypted connections, both from clients and to the PostgreSQL server.
- **Authentication**: Allows for flexible authentication methods such as plaintext, MD5, or more advanced options like client certificates.
- **Low resource usage**: Due to its lightweight design, PgBouncer has minimal memory and CPU requirements, making it suitable for running alongside your application or on a central server.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: PgBouncer can be installed from the package repositories of most major Linux distributions, or compiled from source.

2. **Configuration**: To configure PgBouncer, you need to create a `pgbouncer.ini` file containing the necessary settings, such as the connection details of your PostgreSQL server, the desired pooling mode, and the authentication method.

Example:

```ini
[databases]
mydb = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb

[pgbouncer]
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
listen_port = 6432
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
pool_mode = transaction
max_client_conn = 1000
default_pool_size = 50
```

3. **Client Configuration**: Clients will need to modify their connection settings to connect to PgBouncer (usually running on a different port) instead of the PostgreSQL server directly.

4. **Monitoring**: PgBouncer provides a virtual `pgbouncer` database, where you can send SQL queries to retrieve connection statistics, active connection pool status, and other runtime information.

## Benefits

By using PgBouncer, you can:

- Improve the performance and stability of your application by reusing database connections.
- Reduce your PostgreSQL server's resource requirements and increase its capacity to handle a higher number of clients.
- Simplify client connection management by having a central connection pooler.

Overall, PgBouncer is a valuable tool for PostgreSQL DBA and it's essential for managing high-concurrency applications that require optimal performance and resource efficiency.
