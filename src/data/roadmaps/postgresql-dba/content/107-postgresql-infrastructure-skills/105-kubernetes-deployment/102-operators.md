# Operators

## Operators in Kubernetes

Operators are a method of how to extend the Kubernetes API and manage custom resources, which are specific to the application they manage. They build upon and fully utilize Kubernetes concepts, like `CustomResourceDefinition` (CRD) and `Controller`. Operators are mainly designed to handle application-specific operational tasks, with a focus on automation and scaling, to enable smoother work with Kubernetes perspectives.

In the context of PostgreSQL, operators can manage the deployment, configuration, backups, and failover mechanisms for your PostgreSQL cluster.

### How do Operators work?

Kubernetes Operators work in a loop:

1. Watch for changes in the custom resources
2. Analyze the current state and desired state
3. Perform necessary actions to reach the desired state

This control loop helps to maintain the state of resources all the time, providing the benefits of:
   - Built-in best practices and automation for complex stateful applications
   - Reduce human interventions, repetitive work and chances of error
   - Auto-scaling and self-healing in case of failures

### PostgreSQL Operators

There are various PostgreSQL Operators available, each having their respective advantages and trade-offs. Some popular ones include:

- [Zalando's PostgreSQL Operator](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator): Advanced operator with highly customizable deployments, with a focus on High Availability (HA) and failover.
- [CrunchyData's PostgreSQL Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator): Provides full application stack deployments along with disaster recovery, cloning, monitoring, and more.
- [StackGres](https://stackgres.io/): A fully-featured operator with a focus on simplicity, providing a web UI and seamless integration with other tools.

### Getting Started with Operators

To work with Kubernetes and PostgreSQL operators, follow these steps:

1. Choose and install the appropriate PostgreSQL Operator for your use case. Detailed guides and documentation are provided by each operator.
2. Deploy your PostgreSQL cluster using the custom resources and configurations specific to the selected operator.
3. Manage and monitor your PostgreSQL cluster using the operator's dedicated tools and Kubernetes-native systems.

By properly utilizing PostgreSQL Operators in Kubernetes, you could create a powerful environment for managing and maintaining your PostgreSQL deployments while saving time, effort and reducing the risk of errors in manual tasks.
