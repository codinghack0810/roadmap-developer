# Helm

## Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the process of deploying and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster. Helm uses a packaging format called _charts_, which are collections of files that describe the necessary resources and configurations for running an application or service inside a Kubernetes cluster.

### Key Components of Helm

* **Charts**: Helm packages are called charts. A chart is a group of files that define a complete application stack, including Kubernetes objects such as deployments, services, and configuration files.
* **Releases**: An instance of a chart running on your Kubernetes cluster is called a release. Helm allows you to roll back to a previous release, making it easy to test and troubleshoot changes without affecting production systems. It also handles versioning of your deployments.
* **Repositories**: Helm manages your charts through repositories, which are storage locations for your chart packages. You can create your own repositories or use existing ones, such as the public Helm charts repository.

### Installing Helm
To get started with Helm, you first need to install the helm CLI on your machine. You can follow the [official guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to choose the installation method that suits your operating system.

Once you have Helm installed, you need to set up your Kubernetes context and Tiller, the server-side component of Helm:

```bash
# Initialize helm and install Tiller
helm init
```

### Using Helm
After setting up Helm, you can use it to deploy applications in your Kubernetes cluster. Here is the basic workflow for using Helm:

1. Search for a chart in the public repository or another repository you have access to:

   ```bash
   helm search <chart_name>
   ```
   
2. Install a chart from a repository to create a release in your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   helm install <repo>/<chart_name>
   ```

3. List and manage the releases on your cluster:

   ```bash
   # List all releases
   helm ls
   
   # Roll back to a previous release
   helm rollback <release_name> <version>
   
   # Uninstall a release
   helm uninstall <release_name>
   ```

4. You can also create your own charts for your applications or services. Follow the [official guide](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/) to create your first chart.

Helm greatly simplifies Kubernetes deployment processes and is a critical tool in a PostgreSQL DBA's toolbox to effectively manage and deploy PostgreSQL instances on Kubernetes.
