# MVCC

## Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)

One of the most important concepts in PostgreSQL for maintaining data consistency and handling simultaneous transactions is **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**.

### What is MVCC?

MVCC is a technique used by PostgreSQL to allow concurrent access to the database by multiple users without conflicts. It does this by creating a separate snapshot of the database for each transaction. Instead of locking the data when a row is being read or modified, PostgreSQL uses these snapshots to present users with a consistent view of the data. This way, they can work concurrently without data inconsistencies or delays due to locks.

### How does MVCC work?

Here's an overview of how MVCC works in PostgreSQL:

1. **Transactions and Snapshots:** When a transaction starts, PostgreSQL creates a snapshot of the database at that point in time. Any changes made within the transaction are not visible to other transactions until it's committed.

2. **Row Versioning:** Whenever a row is modified, PostgreSQL creates a new row version with the changes rather than updating the existing row. Each row version has a unique system-generated transaction ID.

3. **Visibility Rules:** When a transaction reads a row, PostgreSQL checks the transaction ID and the row version to determine if the row is visible to the transaction. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data according to its snapshot.

4. **Vacuuming:** Since multiple row versions are created due to MVCC, PostgreSQL needs to periodically clean up these old and unused row versions. This process is known as 'vacuuming'. The `VACUUM` command reclaims storage space, optimizes the performance of the database, and removes dead row versions.

### Benefits of MVCC

- **Concurrency:** MVCC allows multiple transactions to run concurrently without causing data inconsistency or delays due to locking.

- **Isolation:** Each transaction works on a consistent snapshot of the database, ensuring proper isolation between transactions.

- **Consistency:** MVCC ensures that only the committed changes are visible to other transactions, providing a consistent view of the data.

- **Reduced Lock Contention:** By avoiding locks for read and write operations, MVCC minimizes lock contention and improves the overall performance of the database.

In summary, MVCC provides a way for PostgreSQL to handle concurrent transactions efficiently while maintaining data consistency, avoiding contention, and ensuring reliable performance. As a PostgreSQL DBA, understanding the concept of MVCC will help you in managing and optimizing your databases effectively.
