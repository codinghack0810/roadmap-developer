# Object Model

## Object Model in PostgreSQL

In the context of the PostgreSQL DBA guide, the Object Model is an essential concept to grasp for managing and effectively utilizing the RDBMS. PostgreSQL, like other RDBMS, is built on the principles of the Object-Relational model, which basically means it has efficient mechanisms for managing and organizing database objects, such as tables, indexes, and procedures.

### Key Database Objects

PostgreSQL's object model includes several key database objects:

1. **Schema**: A namespace that logically organizes other database objects, such as tables and views. The schema allows multiple objects to have the same name across different schemas without any conflicts.

2. **Table**: It represents a collection of rows containing data with fixed columns that define the structure of the table.

3. **Column**: A column is a defined set of data items of a specific type within a table.

4. **Index**: Indexes are database objects that allow efficient retrieval of rows in a table by providing a specific lookup on one or more columns.

5. **View**: A view is a virtual table constructed from queries of one or more existing tables.

6. **Materialized View**: A Materialized View is a database object that contains the results of a query, similar to a view, but with the data cached locally for faster access.

7. **Trigger**: A trigger is a procedural code that runs automatically based on certain specified events in the database. These events include any operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE statements.

8. **Stored Procedure**: A stored procedure is a user-defined function that is called by clients to execute some predefined operations.

These are just a few of the most commonly used database objects in PostgreSQL. By understanding the roles and interdependencies of these objects, you can fully leverage the benefits that PostgreSQL offers as an advanced RDBMS.

### Object Identification

Each object in PostgreSQL can be uniquely identified by the combination of its name along with its schema and the owner credentials. PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for object names, and follows certain conventions for automatic case conversion.

PostgreSQL allows you to create your own custom data types and operators, thereby extending the functionality of the built-in types and operators. This extensibility helps in catering to any specific requirements of your application or organization.

In summary, the object model in PostgreSQL is an essential concept for managing RDBMS effectively. Understanding its key components and object-relational nature enables efficient organization and usage of database objects, which ultimately leads to better performance and maintainability in the long run.
