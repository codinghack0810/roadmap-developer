# Queries

## Queries

PostgreSQL, being an advanced and versatile relational database management system, offers various ways to efficiently perform queries on the data stored within its tables. In this section, we will cover some fundamental aspects, as well as best practices regarding query execution in PostgreSQL, ensuring you have a solid foundation for your PostgreSQL DBA journey.

### SELECT statement

The `SELECT` statement is the central part of any query in SQL. This is used to retrieve data from one or more tables, based on specified conditions. A simple `SELECT` query would look like the snippet shown below:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE conditions;
```

You can use various techniques to further improve the readability and optimization of your queries, such as joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, sorting, and limits.

### Joins

Joins combine data from two or more tables into a single result set. PostgreSQL supports various types of joins such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`. Make sure to choose the type of join that fits your use case in order to minimize performance overhead.

### Subqueries

Subqueries (or nested queries) are simply queries within queries. This can be useful when you need to manipulate or filter data based on the results of another query. Subqueries usually reside inside parentheses and can form part of several clauses, such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`.

### Aggregate Functions

PostgreSQL provides several built-in aggregate functions, which can be used to calculate values like the sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum based on a set of rows. Some commonly used aggregate functions are `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.

### Sorting

To organize the output of a query, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause, which sorts the returned rows according to the specified column(s). By default, the ordering is ascending (`ASC`), but you can also choose descending order (`DESC`).

### Limiting Results

Sometimes, you might only need a certain number of results obtained from a query. You can use the `LIMIT` keyword, followed by the maximum number of rows you want to fetch, to achieve this. Additionally, you can use the `OFFSET` keyword to determine the starting point of the returned rows.

### Query Performance

Write efficient queries by considering the following best practices:

- Minimize the number of columns and rows you retrieve: Only select the columns and rows you need.
- Use indexes: Ensure that the columns you filter or join on have proper indexes.
- Make use of materialized views: Store complex query results in a separate table in order to reduce the overall computation time.
- Parallelize large queries: Break down large queries into smaller parts and execute them in parallel to improve query performance.

By maintaining best practices while implementing queries in PostgreSQL, you can effectively manage the execution process of your PostgreSQL Databases.
