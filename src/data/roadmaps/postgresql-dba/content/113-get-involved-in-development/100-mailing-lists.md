# Mailing Lists

## Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are an essential part of the PostgreSQL community and a primary means of communication among the developers, contributors, and users of the project. By subscribing to these mailing lists, you can stay up-to-date with the ongoing project developments, participate in discussions and debates, share your knowledge, and seek assistance with any issues that you may encounter. The following are some of the popular PostgreSQL mailing lists:

### General Mailing Lists

- **pgsql-announce**: A low-volume mailing list that provides important announcements regarding new PostgreSQL releases, security updates, and other significant events.
- **pgsql-general**: A high-volume mailing list focused on general PostgreSQL discussions, including user inquiries, troubleshooting, and technical discussions.

### Developer Mailing Lists

- **pgsql-hackers**: A mailing list dedicated to PostgreSQL development discussions, including bug reports, feature proposals, code review, and commit notifications.
- **pgsql-docs**: This list focuses on the development and improvement of PostgreSQL documentation.

### Regional Mailing Lists

There are also several regional mailing lists available in different languages for non-English speaking PostgreSQL users and enthusiasts.

### How to Subscribe?

To subscribe to a mailing list, visit the [PostgreSQL Mailing Lists](https://www.postgresql.org/list/) page and select the desired mailing list. Follow the instructions to subscribe or access the archives containing past discussions.

> **Tip**: Remember that mailing lists are public forums with a vast audience. Always practice good etiquette and respect when participating in discussions or seeking help.
