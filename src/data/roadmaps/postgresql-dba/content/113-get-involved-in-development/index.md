# Get Involved in Development

As a PostgreSQL Database Administrator (DBA), you'll likely find yourself wanting to contribute more to the PostgreSQL community, specifically in its development. Becoming involved in PostgreSQL development can help you improve your skills, network with other experts, and contribute to the project's growth. In addition, it will keep you up-to-date with new features, techniques, and best practices. This section will explore various ways you can get involved in PostgreSQL development.

## Join Mailing Lists and Online Communities

To stay informed and get involved, you can join one or more PostgreSQL mailing lists or online communities relevant to your interests. The main mailing list for PostgreSQL development is called [pgsql-hackers](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-hackers/), where developers discuss features, bugs, patches, and other development-related topics. You can subscribe to the mailing list, contribute by replying to threads, or submit new topics if you have questions or ideas.

## Submit Bug Reports

As a DBA, you may encounter issues and bugs in your PostgreSQL usage. Reporting these bugs on the [PostgreSQL bug tracker](https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/) helps the community identify and resolve problems, contributing to a more stable and reliable system. Ensure you provide an accurate and detailed description of the issue, the steps required to reproduce it, and any additional information that could help developers investigate the problem.

## Develop and Contribute Patches

You can develop and contribute patches to sections of the PostgreSQL codebase or submit new features for review. This might seem intimidating at first, but with your DBA experience and knowledge, you can make a valuable contribution to PostgreSQL's growth. You can submit your patches via the [PostgreSQL Patch Submission](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/contributing/patches/) system. Make sure to follow the guidelines related to coding style, patch format, and communication.

## Contribute to Extensions and Add-Ons

PostgreSQL has a rich ecosystem of extensions and add-ons that provide additional functionality, and you can contribute to these in various ways. You might want to develop your own extensions to solve specific problems, improve existing extensions by submitting patches or updates, or provide documentation and help to other users.

## Attend Conferences and Meetups

Attending PostgreSQL-related events, such as [PGCon](https://www.pgcon.org/), [PostgreSQL Conference Europe](https://2021.pgconf.eu/), or local meetups, helps you network with other experts, developers, and DBAs. In addition to gaining exposure to new ideas and techniques, you can also contribute by presenting your own experiences, giving talks, and participating in discussions.

When you take part in PostgreSQL development, you not only contribute to the project's success but also strengthen your skills as a DBA. Embrace this opportunity to collaborate with the PostgreSQL community, improve the system, and learn from your peers.
