# Using `systemd`

## Using Systemd for PostgreSQL

Systemd is an init-based system manager for Linux that provides a standardized way of managing system processes. It is commonly used for starting, stopping, and controlling processes such as PostgreSQL, which can be installed as a service. In this section, we will explore how to manage PostgreSQL using systemd.

### Installing PostgreSQL with systemd

When installing PostgreSQL through various package managers (e.g., `apt` or `yum`), the installation process will typically configure the service to run using systemd. The PostgreSQL service should *not* be started manually. Instead, we control the service using systemd commands.

### Start and Stop PostgreSQL via systemd

To start PostgreSQL using systemd, run the following command:

```
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

To stop PostgreSQL using systemd, run the following command:

```
sudo systemctl stop postgresql
```

### Enable and Disable PostgreSQL auto-start

To enable PostgreSQL to start automatically with the system, run the command:

```
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

To disable PostgreSQL auto-start, run the command:

```
sudo systemctl disable postgresql
```

### Check the PostgreSQL service status

To check the status of the PostgreSQL service, use the following command:

```
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```

This command will show whether the PostgreSQL service is running, stopped or failed, and display relevant log messages from systemd journal.

### Configuration and Log files

Systemd manages the PostgreSQL service using a unit configuration file, typically located at `/etc/systemd/system/postgresql.service` or `/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service`. It provides a standard way of defining how the PostgreSQL service is started, stopped, and restarted.

PostgreSQL log files can be accessed using the journalctl command:

```
sudo journalctl -u postgresql --since "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

Replace the "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" with the desired date and time to view logs since that specific time.

### Conclusion

Systemd provides a convenient and standardized approach to managing the PostgreSQL service on Linux. Understanding how to interact with the PostgreSQL service through systemd commands will help you efficiently manage your PostgreSQL installation and troubleshoot issues when they arise.
