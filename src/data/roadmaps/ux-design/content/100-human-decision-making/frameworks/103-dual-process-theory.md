# Dual Process Theory

Dual Process theory is a psychological theory that describes how people make decisions. It is based on the idea that people use two distinct modes of thinking: System 1 thinking and System 2 thinking. System 1 thinking is associated with intuitive and automatic processing, while System 2 thinking is associated with deliberate and analytical processing. By understanding how users switch between these modes of thinking, UX designers can create interfaces that are easy to use and intuitive, while also providing the necessary information and options for more deliberate decision-making.
