# Spectrum of Thinking Interventions

In UX design, thinking interventions help designers and researchers to approach problems from different perspectives and generate creative solutions. Divergent thinking interventions such as brainstorming, mind mapping, and SCAMPER are used to explore a broad range of ideas and possibilities. Convergent thinking interventions, such as prioritization, decision-making, and A/B testing, help to evaluate and refine ideas, and ultimately make data-driven decisions. By utilizing a range of thinking interventions, UX designers can create user experiences that are both innovative and effective.
