# Nudge Theory

Nudge theory is a psychological theory that describes how people make decisions. It is based on the idea that people are more likely to make decisions that are in their best interest when they are given the opportunity to make those decisions themselves. By understanding how users make decisions, UX designers can create interfaces that are easy to use and intuitive, while also providing the necessary information and options for more deliberate decision-making.
