# Behavior Design

Behavior design is the practice of designing user experiences that promote behavior change, by leveraging principles of psychology, human decision-making, and persuasive technology. Behavior design involves understanding user motivations, designing interfaces and interactions that make desired behaviors easy to perform, and providing timely feedback and encouragement. By using behavior design techniques, UX designers can create interfaces and interactions that help users achieve their goals and promote positive behavior change.
