# Persuasive Technology

Persuasive technology refers to the use of technology to influence human behavior and decision-making. In the context of UX, it involves designing interfaces and interactions that encourage users to perform a desired behavior or take a specific action, using techniques such as gamification, social proof, and scarcity. However, it is important to use persuasive technology ethically and responsibly, being transparent about its use and avoiding manipulative or deceptive practices.
