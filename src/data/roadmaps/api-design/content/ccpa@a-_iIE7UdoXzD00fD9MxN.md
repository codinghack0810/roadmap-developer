# CCPA under Standards and Compliance in API Design

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a pivotal state statute meant to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for individuals within California, United States. API Design greatly impacts compliance with CCPA, as improper management and exposure of user data can potentially violate this law. Crucially, designing APIs means considering data privacy, security, and user consent from the very foundation. Programmatically, CCPA compliance may involve structuring APIs to respond to user demands such as data access, data deletion, and opt-out requests. It imposes a significant responsibility on API developers to enforce user control over data and maintain rigorous standards of data protection.
