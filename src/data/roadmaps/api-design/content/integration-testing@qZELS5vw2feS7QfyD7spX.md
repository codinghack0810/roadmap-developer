# Integration Testing in API Design

Integration testing is a critical aspect of API design. It is a level of software testing where individual units or components are combined and tested as a group. The main purpose of integration testing in API design is to expose faults and discrepancies in the interaction between integrated units. This testing approach ensures that the different parts of an API work together seamlessly, to deliver the necessary functionality and performance. It helps detect issues related to the network, database, and performance, which unit tests cannot uncover. Thus, this level of testing is instrumental in validating the reliability, efficiency, and functionality of an API's integrated components.
