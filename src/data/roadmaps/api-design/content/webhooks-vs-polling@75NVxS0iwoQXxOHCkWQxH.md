# Webhooks vs Polling in API Design

When it comes to managing server communication and data exchange in API design, two commonly used methods are webhooks and polling. These two strategies handle updates and data synchronization in different ways. Polling is a technique where the client repeatedly makes a request to the server to check for updates. In this case, it's the client determining the rate of information exchange. Conversely, webhooks operate on a 'push' mechanism. The server sends updates to the client as they happen, providing real-time, efficient data synchronization. Determining which method to use often depends on the specifics of the API design requirement including the frequency of data changes, server load, and application's real-time need.
