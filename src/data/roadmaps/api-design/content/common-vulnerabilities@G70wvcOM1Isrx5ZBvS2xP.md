# Common Vulnerabilities in API Design

API design is a critical component of modern software development, enabling various applications to communicate and share data. However, as the use of APIs expands, so does the potential for security vulnerabilities. Understanding common vulnerabilities in API design is crucial to protecting sensitive data and maintaining a secure system. These vulnerabilities might arise due to lack of proper validation, weak authentication mechanisms, insecure endpoint configurations among others. This topic will delve into these common vulnerabilities, focusing on their identification, potential impacts, and how to design APIs with security best practices to mitigate these threats.
