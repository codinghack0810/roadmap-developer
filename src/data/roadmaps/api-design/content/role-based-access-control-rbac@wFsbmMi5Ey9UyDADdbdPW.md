# Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in API Design

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of managing authorization in API design that assigns system access to users based on their role within an organization. RBAC is crucial in controlling which endpoints a user can call, and what operations they are allowed to execute. In the context of API design, RBAC ensures appropriate levels of access for different types of users to guarantee data security and integrity. It simplifies the process of security administration by assigning privileges based on a user's job function, rather than on an individual basis.
