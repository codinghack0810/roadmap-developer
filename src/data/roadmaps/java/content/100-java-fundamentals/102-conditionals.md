# Conditionals

Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed if the same condition is false
- Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test; if the first condition is false
- Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
- Use `?,:` operator to specify one line condition
