# Javascript Iterators and Generators

Iterators and generators, introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6, represent an extremely useful concept related to iteration in the language. Iterators are objects, abiding by the iterator protocol, that allows us to easily iterate over a given sequence in various ways, such as using the `for...of` loop. Generators, on the other hand, allow us to use functions and the `yield` keyword to easily define iterable sequences that are iterators as well.
