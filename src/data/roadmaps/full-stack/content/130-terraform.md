# Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure in a declarative manner. It is developed by HashiCorp and is written in the Go programming language. Terraform supports multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and many others. It uses a configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to write infrastructure definitions, and it maintains the state of your infrastructure in a state file.
