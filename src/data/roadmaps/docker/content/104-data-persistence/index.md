# Data Persistence in Docker

Docker enables you to run containers that are isolated pieces of code, including applications and their dependencies, separated from the host operating system. Containers are ephemeral by default, which means any data stored in the container will be lost once it is terminated. To overcome this problem and retain data across container lifecycles, Docker provides various data persistence methods.
