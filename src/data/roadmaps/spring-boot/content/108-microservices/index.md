# Microservices

Spring Microservices is a framework that makes it easier to build and manage microservices-based applications using the Spring Framework. Microservices is an architectural style in which a large application is built as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Each service has a narrowly defined responsibility and communicates with other services through APIs.
