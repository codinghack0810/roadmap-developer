# Authentication

Spring Security is a framework for securing Java-based applications. One of its core features is authentication, which is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Spring Security provides a wide range of options for implementing authentication, including support for traditional username/password-based authentication as well as more modern alternatives such as OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
