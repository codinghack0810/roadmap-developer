# SOAP APIs

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs are a standard communication protocol system that permits programs that run on different operating systems (like Linux and Windows) to communicate using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its Extensible Markup Language (XML). In the context of API Design, SOAP APIs offer a robust and well-defined process for interaction between various software applications, mostly over a network. They are highly extensible, versatile and support a wide range of communications protocols. Despite being more complex compared to other API types like REST, SOAP APIs ensure high reliability and security, making them the choice for certain business-focused, high-transaction applications.
