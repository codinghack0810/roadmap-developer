# PCI DSS in API Design

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a widely accepted set of policies and procedures intended to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information. In terms of API Design, building APIs in compliance with PCI DSS is crucial when processing, storing or transmitting credit card information. By adhering to these standards, not only can developers ensure safe and secure API endpoints but also build trust among users by safeguarding their sensitive financial data.
