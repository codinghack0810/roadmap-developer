# Contract Testing in API Design

Contract Testing is a critical aspect of maintaining a robust and reliable API infrastructure. In the realm of API design, Contract Testing refers to the method of ensuring that APIs work as anticipated and that changes to them do not break their intended functionality. This approach validates the interaction between two different systems, typically consumer and provider ( API), ensuring they comply with their agreed-upon contract. By defining clear and concise contracts for our APIs, developers can avoid common deployment issues and enhance system integration processes.
