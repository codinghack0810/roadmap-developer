# Prioritization Techniques

Prioritization Techniques are the key strategies implemented by product managers to determine where to allocate resources and focus development efforts. These techniques help in identifying the most valuable and impactful features, products, and projects to undertake. Since time, budget, and resources are limited, it is crucial to prioritize works that align with the business objectives, customer needs, and market trends. These techniques can range from simple to sophisticated; including methods like the Eisenhower Matrix, RICE scoring, Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF), and more. Mastering these techniques facilitates a product manager in making informed decisions and delivering maximum value to the customers and the business.
