# Risk Audits in Product Management

Risk audits form an integral part of the product management process. As a Product Manager, conducting risk audits involves comprehensive assessment of the various potential risks associated with the development and launch of a product. These risks could range from functional issues, design flaws, marketing challenges, to various other uncertainties that may potentially impact the success of a product. Risk audits aim to identify these threats ahead of time, mitigate them effectively, and devise strategies to turn these risks into opportunities. This rigorous process helps a Product Manager to ensure the smooth continuity of production, enabling robust, timely, and financial-efficient deployments of products.
