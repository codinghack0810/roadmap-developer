# A/B Testing for Product Managers

A/B testing, otherwise known as split testing, is an essential statistical tool that is central to the responsibilities of a product manager. This method involves comparing two versions of a webpage, product feature, or user interface to determine which performs better according to certain metrics or goals. It allows product managers to make data-driven decisions and improve the product based on real user experiences and preferences. A solid understanding of A/B testing methods and application equips product managers with the ability to optimize user engagement, retention and conversion rates.
