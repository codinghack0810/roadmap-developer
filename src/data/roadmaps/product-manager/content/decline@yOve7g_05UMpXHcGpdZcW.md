# Decline in Product Management

The decline phase of the product development lifecycle comes after the development, introduction, growth, and maturity stages, characterized by decreasing sales and market relevance. For product managers, this phase involves making strategic decisions regarding the product's future, such as discontinuation, repositioning, or reinvention. The focus shifts to cost reduction, managing inventory, and maximizing any remaining value from the product. Effective management during the decline phase is essential for mitigating losses, reallocating resources to more promising products, and planning for a smooth exit or transition, ensuring minimal disruption to the overall product portfolio.
