# User Story Mapping in Backlog Management

User Story Mapping is a crucial practice product managers adopt under the broad area of backlog management. This strategic process encourages the development team and stakeholders to have a collaborated understanding of the product or application, as it aligns them into visualization and diagraming of user activities. User Story Mapping provides a structured approach to defining user interactions with the product, assisting Product Managers to prioritize requirements, and ultimately leading to a product that meets the needs of the users effectively. This approach allows the product manager to set realistic goals, enable seamless team collaboration, and ensure an efficient project schedule that captures the product's functionality from the user's perspective.
