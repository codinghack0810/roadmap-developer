# Daily Standups

Daily standups, also known as daily scrum meetings, are a crucial part of a Product Manager's role in an Agile framework. They function as short, highly focused meetings where each team member summarizes their work since the last standup, their plan until the next one, and any obstacles encountered. For a Product Manager, participating and sometimes facilitating these meetings not only offers a clear view of the project's progress, but also helps in identifying and eliminating potential impediments for the team.
