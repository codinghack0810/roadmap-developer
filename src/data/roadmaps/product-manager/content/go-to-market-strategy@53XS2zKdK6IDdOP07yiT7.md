# Go-to-Market Strategy

A Go-to-Market (GTM) strategy is an action plan that specifies how a product manager will reach target customers and achieve a competitive advantage. It serves as a blueprint that guides companies in introducing their products to the market. For a product manager, the GTM strategy is not just about product launch, it includes understanding the market dynamics, customer needs, creating marketing and sales strategies, and post-launch activities like customer service. An effective GTM strategy can help product managers ensure a successful product launch and strong market presence.
