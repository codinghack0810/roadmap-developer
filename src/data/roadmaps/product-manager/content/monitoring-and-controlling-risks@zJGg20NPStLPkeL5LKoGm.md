# Monitoring and Controlling Risks 

In the realm of product management, monitoring and controlling risks is a critical responsibility. This process entails identifying potential areas of risks in product development and implementing strategies to mitigate them. Consequently, it involves continuous vigilance to ensure that potential threats do not escalate into problems that could jeopardize the success of the product. Product managers are often tasked with predicting likely risks, developing contingency plans and ensuring contractual compliance to keep the product development process smooth and within specified constraints. Their role hence extends beyond mere product vision and development, into a vital aspect of business strategy and risk management.
