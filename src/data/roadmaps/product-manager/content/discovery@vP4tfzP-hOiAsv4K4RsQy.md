# Discovery

The discovery phase is a crucial stage in a Product Manager's role. It involves exploring, researching, understanding customer needs, and identifying market opportunities to develop a product that aligns with business goals while providing value to users. During this phase, Product Managers gather and analyze data from customers, competitors, and the market to clearly define the problem to be solved. Visual forms like customer journey maps, personas, or prototypes are often used to effectively communicate the findings. The insights gained during the discovery phase set the foundation for the decisions made in the subsequent product development phases.
