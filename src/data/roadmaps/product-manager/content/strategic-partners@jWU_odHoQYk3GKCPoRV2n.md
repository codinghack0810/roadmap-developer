# Strategic Partners

In the role of a Product Manager, a crucial aspect is managing and guiding strategic partners. Strategic partners are organizations or individuals that a company forms alliance with to mutually develop, promote, and distribute products or services. For a product manager, this involves understanding the capabilities of potential partners, determining how to leverage their strengths for the product's growth, as well as maintaining a positive and productive relationship with them throughout the product lifecycle. This could range from sourcing raw materials to providing distribution network or even technological support, depending on the nature of the product. In brief, strategic partners significantly contribute in shaping the product's roadmap, influencing its performance in the market, and advancing overall business objectives.
