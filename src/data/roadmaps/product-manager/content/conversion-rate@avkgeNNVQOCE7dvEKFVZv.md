# Conversion Rate: A Key Product Metric

The Conversion Rate is a crucial product metric for any Product Manager. It is the percentage of users who complete a desired action on a product or service, such as making a purchase, signing up for a trial, or subscribing to a newsletter. Monitoring conversion rates allows Product Managers to understand how effectively their product is meeting target audience needs, achieving business goals, and driving desired customer behaviors. It helps in identifying areas of improvement, opportunities for growth, and impact of changes on user interactions.
