# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a crucial concept in the realm of product management. As a Product Manager, one is often tasked with defining and overseeing the development of the MVP. This refers to a version of a new product that allows a team to collect the most amount of validated learnings about customers with the least amount of effort. The principal advantage lies in understanding the interest and needs of the customers while saving time and resources. An effectively defined MVP can provide significant market insights, improve user experience in the final product, and increase likelihood for a successful product launch.
