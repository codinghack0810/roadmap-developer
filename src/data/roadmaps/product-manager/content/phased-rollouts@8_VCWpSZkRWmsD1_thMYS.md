# Phased Rollouts

Phased rollouts refer to the strategy of gradually introducing a new product or service in the market. As a Product Manager, adopting a phased rollout approach is crucial as it allows the identification and resolution of potential issues in real-time, without impacting the entire user base. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to garner early feedback for improvements before a product is fully launched to the entire market. This strategy helps in minimizing risks as well as ensuring a smooth user experience. The valuable insights gained during this process aids the Product Manager in refining the product and building better solutions.
