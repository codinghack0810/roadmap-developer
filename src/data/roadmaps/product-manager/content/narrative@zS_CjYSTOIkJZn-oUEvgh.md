# Narrative under Vision & Mission

A Product Manager, in their role, often stands as the conduit linking different business components, including customers, sales, marketing, and engineering. A crucial aspect of this role involves crafting the narrative under the Vision & Mission of their product. This narrative is a strategically designed story that brings to life, the product's purpose, its potential market impact, and the roadmap to its success. The narrative not only sets the direction for the team but it also helps stakeholders understand the product’s strategic importance. From illustrating the product's value proposition to external audiences to aligning internal teams, a solid, compelling narrative, shaped by the Product Manager, is crucial in defining and driving a product’s vision and mission.
