# Feature Toggles

Feature toggles, also known as feature flags, are a powerful technique giving product managers an advanced control over the features of the product which are visible to specific users. It allows teams to modify a software system's behavior without necessarily changing the code. Feature toggles provide the flexibility of enabling or disabling certain parts of the application, facilitating testing, continuous deployment and facilitating roll-out or roll-back of features. As a product manager, understanding the use of feature toggles is crucial in efficiently managing the release process and reducing risks associated with deploying new features.
