# Grooming Sessions

In the realm of product management, grooming sessions are a crucial part of the Agile product development process. Also known as backlog refinement or story-time sessions, they help product managers, along with the development team, prioritise and refine the product backlog to ensure smooth execution of product delivery. During grooming sessions, product manager clarifies doubts about product backlog items, re-orders them based on business or technical priority and often breaks down large user stories into smaller, manageable tasks. They are integral in maintaining a well-organised, clear and up-to-date product roadmap.
