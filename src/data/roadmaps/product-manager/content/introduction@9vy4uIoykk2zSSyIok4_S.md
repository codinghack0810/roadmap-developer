# Introduction to Product Management

The role of a Product Manager is arguably one of the most important in any tech company. Responsible for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team that is responsible for improving it, a Product Manager is essentially the chief advocate for a product's feature set and overall business value. In fact, a Product Manager often analyzes market and competitive conditions and lays out a product vision that is differentiated and delivers unique value based on customer demands. The role of a Product Manager spans many activities from strategic to tactical and provides important cross-functional leadership â€” most notably between engineering, marketing, sales, and support teams. As the product's key strategist and advocate, a Product Manager communicates the voice of the customer and strives to maximize the value of their product, for both users and the company.
