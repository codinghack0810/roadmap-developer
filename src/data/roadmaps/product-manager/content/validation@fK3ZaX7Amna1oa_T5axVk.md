# Validation

Validation in the context of Product Management, refers to the process of ensuring that a product, feature, or concept meets the needs and expectations of the targeted end-user population. Product Managers carry out this process before the development phase to mitigate risks and avoid potentially costly mistakes. Validation helps in identifying if the problem is worth solving, gauges market demand, and validates the proposed solution. Typically, this might involve user interviews, surveys, prototypes, and market research. It plays a crucial role in decreasing uncertainties and refining the product roadmap. Its objective is to build a product that provides sufficient value to customers and meets business goals.
