# Product Roadmap

The product roadmap is a strategic document that provides a detailed overview of the product's direction and vision. It outlines the product's plans, both tactical and strategic - including the specific steps necessary to achieve the company's goals and vision. As a Product Manager, you are expected to guide the creation of the product roadmap, communicating the productâ€™s evolution to the team, stakeholders, and customers. This tool serves as an essential reference point helping to align all stakeholders with the key priorities and vision of the product, and acts as a guide for decisions around product development.
