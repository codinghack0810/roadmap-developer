# Platform Thinking

The role of a Product Manager extends beyond managing individual products. It often involves taking a broader outlook known as Platform Thinking. In the context of product management and particularly in scaling products, Platform Thinking involves considering the product not merely as a standalone offering but as a part of a larger ecosystem. This ecosystem is constituted by other products, services, users, developers, and other actors. A product manager, thus, needs to strategically design, develop, and scale the product in a way that it seamlessly fits into and contributes to the ecosystem, while also gaining valuable inputs and leveraging opportunities originating from the same platform.
