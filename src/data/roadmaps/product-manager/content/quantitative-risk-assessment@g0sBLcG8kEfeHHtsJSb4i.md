# Quantitative Risk Assessment

Product Managers are often required to make important decisions which can significantly affect the success of a product. One of the key decision-making tools they use is Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). QRA is a formal and systematic approach to estimating the probability and consequences of potential product risks. It involves the use of objective and empirical data to calculate the likelihood of a risk occurring and the magnitude of its impact. This methodology provides Product Managers with a data-driven framework to identify, assess, and prioritize risks, enabling them to make informed product decisions and to develop effective risk mitigation strategies.
