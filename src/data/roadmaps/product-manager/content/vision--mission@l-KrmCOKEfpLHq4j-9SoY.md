# Vision & Mission 

A critical aspect of a Product Manager's role is to understand, define and communicate the Vision and Mission of their product. The Vision is the long-term goal, reflecting what the product aims to achieve or become in the future. This provides a strategic direction that aligns all stakeholders. The Mission, on the other hand, is a tactical plan detailing how the product will achieve this Vision. It involves specific, actionable objectives that can be assessed and adjusted periodically. Together, the Vision and Mission guide the Product Manager in making decisions, prioritizing actions and inspiring the team.
