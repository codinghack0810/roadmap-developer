# Risk Register in the Context of Product Management

The Risk Register is an important tool for Product Managers as it systematically identifies and manages potential issues that could negatively impact the outcome of a product's development. It consists of a log of potential risks, quantifying their impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies. This essential document allows Product Managers to prioritize strategies, allocate resources more efficiently, and develop contingency plans. In essence, a Risk Register helps Product Managers to better anticipate, assess, and prepare for the potential bumps on the road to successful product delivery. It encourages a proactive rather than reactive approach to managing risk, contributing to overall product success.
