# Notion as Roadmapping Tool

As a Product Manager, Notion is an indispensable tool in your arsenal for creating roadmaps. This powerful platform is a combination of note-taking, database, project management, and much more. With Notion, you can track the progress of various product initiatives, communicate status updates to stakeholders, and clearly lay out the strategic path ahead. With its flexible, customizable interface and integrations with other useful tools, it is perfectly suited towards collating and synthesizing large amounts of information, which is central to effective product management. The visual nature of Notion's interface makes it particularly well suited for creating compelling, easy-to-understand roadmaps.
