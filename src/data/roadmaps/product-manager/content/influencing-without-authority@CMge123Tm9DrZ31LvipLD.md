# Influencing without Authority

As a Product Manager, the ability to influence without authority is a critical skill set. This is often because Product Managers do not necessarily have direct authority over the team yet are expected to guide product strategies and make vital decisions. Influencing without authority involves convincing others to follow your ideas or approach, and can often include multidirectional influence, not just downward but upward and sideways too. A Product Manager navigates between different stakeholders like cross-functional partnerships, sales, marketing, engineering, design, etc., with varying levels of authority. Mastering the art of Influencing without Authority allows Product Managers to motivate and sway these differing parties to work collectively towards a shared vision or goal, thereby driving the product's success.
