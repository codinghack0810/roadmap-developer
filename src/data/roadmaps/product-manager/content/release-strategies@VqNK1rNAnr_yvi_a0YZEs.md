# Release Strategies 

Release strategies play a critical role in the responsibilities of a Product Manager. Essentially, a release strategy defines the plan for the distribution of the final version of a product. The role of the Product Manager here is to ensure that new releases deliver on the product vision while meeting business objectives. They must carefully plan and manage product releases, outlining what features will be delivered, deciding on the release date, coordinating the teams involved and ensuring the product is effectively launched into the market. An effective release strategy is crucial to achieve the product goals and maximize the value delivered to the customers and business alike.
