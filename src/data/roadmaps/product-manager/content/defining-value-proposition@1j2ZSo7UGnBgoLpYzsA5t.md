# Defining Value Proposition

The Value Proposition serves as the foundation for a product manager's strategy, directly influencing the design, development, and marketing decisions of a product. By defining the unique value your product brings to the market, you communicate its benefits, solve customers' problems, and outdo competitors. A well-articulated value proposition is crucial as it affects every aspect of your productâ€”from conception to final sale. For a product manager, understanding and continually refining the value proposition can guide decision making, target key demographics more effectively, and increase overall user satisfaction.
