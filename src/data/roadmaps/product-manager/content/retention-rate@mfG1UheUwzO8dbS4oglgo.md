# Retention Rate as a Key Product Metric

For a product manager, understanding the retention rate is integral to making key business decisions. This metric refers to the percentage of customers who continue to use a specific product over a given time period. By closely monitoring the retention rate, product managers can gauge the degree to which the product, application, or service meets the needs and expectations of consumers. Low retention rates may indicate dissatisfaction or competition, while high retention rates can suggest user satisfaction and loyalty. Understanding this figure can provide insights into changes that can improve customer engagement and satisfaction, making it a vital aspect of a product manager's role.
