# Key Product Metrics

Key Product Metrics are essential parameters that Product Managers use to measure the performance and success of a product. These set of metrics help understand the usage, engagement, and overall value of a product to its users. Product Managers rely on these insights to inform their decision-making process, prioritize features, identify areas for improvement and evaluate the impact of changes made to the product. From user acquisition and retention rate to churn rate and time spent on product, choosing the right metrics is vital for driving growth and achieving product goals.
