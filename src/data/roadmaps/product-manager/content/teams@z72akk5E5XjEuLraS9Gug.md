# Teams under Communication Tools

In the landscape of product management, communication plays an extraordinary role and Microsoft Teams is one of the most pivotal communication tools in this aspect. A product manager often engages with diverse teams - engineering, design, marketing, sales, and more, ensuring coherence and alignment towards the product vision. The Microsoft Teams platform boosts this communication process, providing a centralized space for conversations, content, meetings, and tasks. Its features like chat, video meetings, file sharing, and integration with other tools significantly streamline collaboration and decision-making, which are integral to a product manager's role.
