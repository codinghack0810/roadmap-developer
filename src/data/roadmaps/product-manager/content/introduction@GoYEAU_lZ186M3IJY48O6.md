# Introduction

The introduction phase of the product development lifecycle marks the transition from development to market entry, where the product is launched and made available to customers. For product managers, this phase involves executing go-to-market strategies, coordinating marketing and sales efforts, and closely monitoring the product's performance in the market. This period is critical for building brand awareness, attracting early adopters, and gathering initial customer feedback. Effective management during the introduction phase ensures a smooth launch, helps identify and resolve any post-launch issues, and sets the foundation for the product's growth and long-term success.
