# Competitive Strategy in Product Management

Product Managers play a crucial role in defining and implementing the competitive strategy of a product. This strategy is typically a long-term action plan for a company that identifies how to achieve a competitive advantage while meeting the needs of its customers. Product managers, with their deep understanding of the market, identify opportunities, understand competitors, and align the product to meet business goals and customers' needs. Strong strategic thinking aids in making informed decisions towards competitive positioning of the product, considering factors such as pricing, features, and marketing strategies.
