# Portfolio Management

Portfolio Management is one of the most critical responsibilities of a Product Manager. It involves the strategic decision-making process aimed at aligning organizational strategy with the efforts of teams tasked with planning, creating, and delivering products. Portfolio management allows product managers to assess how potential products or a set of products can deliver the most value to the company and its customers. Balancing benefits, costs, risks, and resources, while maintaining a keen eye on market trends and competition forms the core of portfolio management for a company. In essence, a Product Manager has to curate the product portfolio in a way that ensures long-term success and growth of a business.
