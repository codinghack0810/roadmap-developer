# Outcome-Based Roadmaps

Outcome-Based Roadmaps refers to the strategic planning approach of focusing on the desired results of an organization or project rather than the specific tasks or features to be completed. For a Product Manager, creating outcome-based roadmaps requires a top-down approach, putting the focus on solving problems and achieving objectives over defining strict specifications or tasks. This allows for more flexibility and innovation in product development and strategy. It also necessitates a deep understanding of customer needs, the ability to articulate clear goals and progression metrics, and the skill to collaborate with cross-functional teams to see those goals to fruition.
