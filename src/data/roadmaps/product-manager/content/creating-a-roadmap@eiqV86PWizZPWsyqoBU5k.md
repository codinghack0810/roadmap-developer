# Creating a Roadmap

A product manager plays an essential role in setting a strategic direction for the products they are tasked with guiding. An integral part of this role is creating a product roadmap. This key document outlines the vision, direction, and progress of the product over time. It is a detailed plan that explains how the product is likely to grow, the strategy behind it, and the steps necessary to achieve its development goals. It is imperative for a product manager to create and maintain a product roadmap, as it provides a clear path for everyone involved and sets realistic expectations regarding the product's evolution. The roadmap keeps the product manager, the development team, stakeholders, and customers on the same page, allowing for seamless collaboration and effective decision-making.
