# Statement under Vision & Mission

As a Product Manager, an integral part of your responsibility revolves around defining and understanding the Vision and Mission statement of the product you are managing. These statements not only align the team and the organization with a specific goal, but they also provide a roadmap of the larger purpose that the product aims to serve in the most succinct way possible. A clear and motivating Vision and Mission statement can lead to empowered teams and efficient decision-making processes. The Vision depicts the ultimate goal of the product, where it aspires to be. The Mission, on the other hand, focuses on the present, defining the purpose of the product, the why and the how behind its existence. Gaining a deep understanding of these statements becomes an essential aspect of successful product management.
