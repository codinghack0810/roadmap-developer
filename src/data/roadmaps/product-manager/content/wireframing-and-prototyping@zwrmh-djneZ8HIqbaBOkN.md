# Wireframing and Prototyping â€“ UX / UI Design

Wireframing and prototyping form an essential part of product development, especially in the domain of UX / UI Design. For a Product Manager, understanding these processes serves as a crucial tool in enabling them to visualize the path of the user interface before it is fully developed. 

A wireframe is a basic, visual guide used to suggest the layout of fundamental elements in a web or mobile application. This serves as a skeleton for the structure of the app. The prototype, however, is a more comprehensive and interactive model of the product. 

By integrating wireframing and prototyping within the design process, a Product Manager can test the product before the development phase, reduce unforeseen costs and changes, improve collaboration with stakeholders, and ultimately, ensure customer satisfaction.
