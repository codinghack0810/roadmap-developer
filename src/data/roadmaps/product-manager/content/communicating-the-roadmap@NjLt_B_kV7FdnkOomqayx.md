# Communicating the Roadmap

An essential role of a Product Manager involves communicating the product roadmap. This strategic document delineates the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It is paramount that this roadmap is communicated effectively to various stakeholders including team members, leadership, clients, and investors. This not only sets appropriate expectations but also ensures that everyone associated with the product is on the same page. The successful alignment increases the chance of product success and reduces the scope of misunderstandings and delays. For a Product Manager, mastering this communication is key to leading a product effectively.
