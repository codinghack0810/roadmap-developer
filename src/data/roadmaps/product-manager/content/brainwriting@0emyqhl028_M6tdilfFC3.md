# Brainwriting in Product Management

Brainwriting is a critical tool in the arsenal of modern Product Managers. It refers to a structured brainstorming technique where team members independently write down their ideas, then pass them on to others for the development and enhancement. In the realm of product management, this can help stimulate creative problem-solving and innovation, paving the way for new features, strategies, and improvements. It's a game-changer as it values the voices of all team members, reduces group pressure, and mitigates the problem of idea domination often present in traditional brainstorming sessions.
