# Launch Planning

The role of a Product Manager is central to launch planning. It involves designing and executing a strategic plan to introduce a new product or feature to the market. In order to ensure the success of the product, a Product Manager needs to collaborate with various departments such as design, development, sales, marketing, and customer service. They are responsible for setting the timeline, allocating resources, identifying target consumers, and setting price points. This requires a detailed understanding of the market, competitors, and the unique value proposed by their product. Launch planning is a critical phase in the product life cycle and its success greatly determines the trajectory of the product in the market.
