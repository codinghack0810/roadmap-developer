# Identifying Stakeholders

As a Product Manager, it's crucial to identify key stakeholders who have a direct or indirect influence on the product's success. These stakeholders can include anyone from customers, team members, organizational leadership, to external business partners. Identifying stakeholders at an early stage can assist in getting their support, understanding their expectations, and mitigating any potential risks they may pose to the product life cycle. It's not only understanding who your stakeholders are, but also their interests, power dynamics, and their potential influence on the productâ€™s success. This process is an essential foundation for effective stakeholder management and ensures alignment across the organization in terms of product vision and objectives.
