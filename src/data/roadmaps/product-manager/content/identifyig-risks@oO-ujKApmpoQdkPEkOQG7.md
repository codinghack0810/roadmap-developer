# Identifying Risks

Risk identification is a critical component in the role of a Product Manager. It involves determining potential threats that could negatively affect the success of a product. These risks could exist in various circumstances, including development, marketing, sales, or even post-launch. 

A Product Manager must be vigilant in recognizing these potential hazards as early as possible in the product lifecycle. This not only involves identifying the risks, but also analyzing and prioritizing them for further action. By doing so, the Product Manager aids in creating risk mitigation strategies, contributing to the overall product strategy and ensuring the success of the product in the market.
