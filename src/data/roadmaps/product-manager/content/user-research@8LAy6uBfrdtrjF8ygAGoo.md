# User Research

User research is a critical aspect of a Product Manager's role. It is through understanding the needs, behaviors, and pain points of a user that a Product Manager can create, refine, and market products successfully. User research is not a one-time event but a continuous process that helps Product Managers stay abreast of their target market's evolving demands and expectations. Methods used include interviews, surveys, usability testing, and observation, among others. By staying connected to the users' perspectives, a Product Manager can ensure a more user-centric product development process resulting in a product that genuinely meets and exceed user expectations.
