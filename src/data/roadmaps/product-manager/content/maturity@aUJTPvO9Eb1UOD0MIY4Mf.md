# Maturity

The maturity phase of the product development lifecycle follows the development, introduction, and growth stages, representing a period where the product has achieved widespread market acceptance and stabilized sales. For product managers, this phase focuses on maintaining market share, optimizing operational efficiency, and extending the product's lifecycle through enhancements and diversification. Strategies during this phase include cost management, refining marketing efforts to retain loyal customers, and exploring opportunities for incremental innovation. Effective management during the maturity phase is crucial for sustaining profitability, fending off competition, and preparing for eventual market saturation or product evolution.
