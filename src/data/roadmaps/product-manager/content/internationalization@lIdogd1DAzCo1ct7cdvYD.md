# Internationalization In Product Management

Internationalization in product management refers to designing a product in a way that can easily be adapted for various international markets without requiring significant changes. This includes not just language translation, but also dealing with cultural differences, local regulations, and multiple time zones. A Product Manager must consider internationalization to ensure its product appeals to different geographical locations thereby facilitating a wider user base, increased market share, and, potentially, profitability.
