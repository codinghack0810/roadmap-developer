To define this strategy, youâ€™ll need to define the following elements:

- The size limit that will trigger the cache eviction when exceeded.
- A monitoring strategy to determine if the eviction strategy is working properly or if it needs adjustment.
- A cache invalidation mechanism.
- And an eviction policy, which could be one of the following:
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Evict the least recently accessed items.
  - **LFU (Least Frequently Used):** Remove items accessed least frequently.
  - **FIFO (First-In, First-Out):** Evict items in the order they were added.
  - **Random:** Randomly select items to evict.
  - **TTL (Time-To-Live):** Expire items after a certain time.
