Starting from the basis of understanding that your inter-service communication is meant to only happen inside private networks (ideally, no public traffic should reach these services), here are some recommendations:

- Use encrypted channels, such as TLS to prevent common attacks such as [man-in-the-middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
- Use an API gateway to manage and authenticate traffic that reaches this private network.
- Enforce authentication and authorization for inter-service messages, making sure that only valid microservices can reach each other, and when they do, they only have access to what it makes sense for them to have.
