An API endpoint is a specific URL that acts as an entry point into a specific service or a functionality within a service.

Through an API endpoint, client applications can interact with the server sending requests (sometimes even with data in the form of payload) and receive a response from it.

Usually, each endpoint can be mapped to a single feature inside the server.
