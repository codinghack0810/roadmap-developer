The following are key considerations to be taken into account:

- Capture only what you need and what you told your users you’d capture. Remember that to comply with GDPR, you have to ask for your user’s consent to collect their data, and you have to specify the actual data points you’re collecting. So focus on those and nothing else.
- Secure your data. As part of the regulations, you have to make sure your data is secured both in transit and at rest. There are regular security audits that have to happen to ensure security is kept high.
- The user has rights over the data you’ve captured, so make sure you give them the right endpoints or services to read it, edit it or even remove it if they want.
