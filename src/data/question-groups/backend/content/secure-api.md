There are many ways to secure an API, here are some of the most common ones:

- Add an authentication method, such as OAuth, JWT, Bearer tokens, Session-based auth, and others.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transfer between client and server.
- Configure strong CORS policies to avoid unwanted requests.
- Setup a strong authorization logic, to ensure clients only access resources they have access to.
