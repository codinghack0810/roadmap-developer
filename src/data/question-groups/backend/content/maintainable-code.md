The trick here is to follow best practices and coding standards such as:

- Modularity.
- Following naming conventions.
- Adding code comments.
- Doing regular refactors to keep technical debt under check.
- Keeping error handling messages consistent throughout the platform.
- Performing unit tests on all written code.
