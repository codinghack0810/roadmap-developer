Some common techniques include:

- Adding and implementing validation rules to prevent invalid data entry. Through the definition of schemas and schema constraints to enforce certain minimum standards, you can prevent data anomalies from happening.
- Implement data versioning to easily revert back if there are any anomalies detected.
- Implement a strong data quality practice to ensure that whatever information enters your system is properly validated and flagged if required.
