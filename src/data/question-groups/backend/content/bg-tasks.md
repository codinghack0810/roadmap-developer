It highly depends on your tech stack and what those background tasks are doing. And because of that, there are many options:

- Using task queues such as RabbitMQ or Amazon SQS. These will let you have workers in the background as secondary processes while your application continues working.
- There are background job frameworks such as [Celery for Python](https://github.com/celery/celery) or [Sidekiq for Ruby](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq).
- You can also just rely on cron jobs if you want.
- If your programming language permits it, you can also use threads or workers to run these tasks in the background but within the same application.
