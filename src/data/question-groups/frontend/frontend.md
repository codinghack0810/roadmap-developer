Preparing for your front end web development interview is key to achieving a successful outcome, but understanding what kind of questions or topics are going to be asked is not easy.

So to help you get ready for your upcoming front end developer interview, here are 30 technical interview questions about web development with a focus on the front end, in other words, about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Keep in mind that they’re grouped by difficulty into three categories: beginners, intermediate and advanced. Ideally, you should aim to understand all of them, and if you find yourself not able to continue, consider checking out the [Frontend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) to figure out what to focus your studies on.

## Preparing for your Front End interview

Before jumping straight into front end interview prep, here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Master the Fundamentals**: Before you start to solve complex problems, you need to make sure you have a solid understanding of front end development basics. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how they work together to create responsive, interactive web pages. Remember that you have the [Front End roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) available if you feel you still need to learn more about any of these topics.
2. **Practice Coding**: You can improve your coding skills through mini-projects or by solving problems on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). Focus on challenges related to front end development.
3. **Learn Modern Frameworks and Libraries**: Get to know popular frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. Understanding these tools is often crucial for modern front end roles.
4. **Tackle the foundational tools of your dev workflow**: Make sure you’re comfortable with essential tools and practices such as version control (e.g., Git), testing (unit and integration testing), and build tools (e.g., Vite). These are crucial for any front end role.
5. **Understand UI/UX Principles**: Understanding basic concepts of design and user experience can set you apart as a front end developer. Try to learn about accessibility, responsive design, and how to create intuitive interfaces.
6. **Research the Company**: Show some interest in the company you’re interviewing with by learning about their business and products. Prepare some questions to ask during the interview to show you care about the role.
7. **Improve your communication skills**. This one is not front end-specific, however, it’s always a good idea to invest in your future.

With these tips out of the way, let's now get into some of the most common Front End interview questions that you’ll encounter!
