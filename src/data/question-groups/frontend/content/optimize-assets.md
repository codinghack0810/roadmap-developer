There are different techniques to improve loading times, depending on the asset type, for example:

- CSS & JavaScript files should be minimized and compressed.
- Images can be compressed when you’re saving them or through the use of specialized software, like [JPEGOptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim) or [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac). Just make sure you don’t lose any quality during the process.
