In CSS, the difference between **inline**, **inline-block**, and **block** elements is on the way they’re rendered in the web page:

- **Inline**: Inline elements don’t have a width or height. Instead, they don’t start on a new line and take up only the width that’s required (based on their content). Examples: &lt;span&gt;, &lt;a&gt;.
- **Inline-block**: Just like inline elements, here the DOM elements do not start on a new line, however, they do allow you to set a height and width on them. Example: &lt;img&gt;.
- **Block**: Elements start on a new line, taking up the full width available by default. Their width and height can be set by you. Examples: &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;.
