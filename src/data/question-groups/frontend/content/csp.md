Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps to avoid cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks by defining and enforcing a whitelist of approved sources, such as scripts, stylesheets, images, and other resources.

The main benefits are:

- **Better Security**: CSP helps protect websites and web apps against various types of attacks, including XSS and data injection.
- **More Contro**l: Developers can define fine-grained policies to control the sources from which content can be loaded.
- **Improved Compliance**: Helps meet security compliance requirements, such as those outlined in OWASP Top 10.
