Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow Front End developers to apply different styles to a document based on various characteristics of the device or viewport. For example, you can set different styles based on the deviceâ€™s width, height, orientation, or type.

Through media queries we can achieve responsive design allowing styles to adapt to different screen sizes and device capabilities.
