Tree shaking is a technique used in JavaScript module bundlers, like Webpack or Vite, to remove unused code from the final bundled output.

Main benefits include:

1. **Reduced Bundle Size:** Removing unused code reduces the size of the JavaScript bundle sent to the client, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage.
2. **Improved Performance:** Smaller bundle sizes can lead to faster parsing and execution times, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness of the web application.
3. **Better Resource Utilization:** Developers can write modular code without worrying about unused dependencies bloating the final bundle size.
