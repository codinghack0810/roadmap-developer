**Cookies** are small pieces of data stored in web browsers. They are mainly used for keeping information between HTTP requests, such as user authentication, session management, and tracking user behavior

On the other hand, **sessionStorage** is designed for temporary storage and is accessible only within the same session (i.e.., while the browser window or tab is open). Data stored in sessionStorage is lost when the browser window is closed.

Finally, **localStorage** is similar to **sessionStorage** but persists even when the browser window or tab is closed and reopened. It provides long-term storage for web applications. They are very similar to cookies, however, the size limitations on localStorage are quite big compared to cookies, making it a much better alternative when storing large datasets.
