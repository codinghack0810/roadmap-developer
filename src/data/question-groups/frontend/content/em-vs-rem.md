![EM vs REM in CSS](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/em-vs-rem-css-jwgx8.png)

They’re both relative units of measurement, however, they’re relative to different things:

1. **“em”** units are relative to the font size of their parent element. So if the parent element has a font size of 20px, then setting a “2em” font size, would equal to 40px.
2. **“rem”** units are “root em”, which means they’re relative to the web page’s root element (the “&lt;html&gt;” element).
