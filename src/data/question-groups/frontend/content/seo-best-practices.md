Purely from the HTML side:

- **Use Semantic HTML**: Use tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to provide meaningful structure.
- **Proper Heading Hierarchy**: Use headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) correctly, making sure &lt;h1&gt; is used once per page for the main title, followed by &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, etc.
- **Meta Tags**: Include relevant &lt;meta&gt; tags, such as description, keywords, and viewport, to provide metadata about the website.
- **Alt Attributes on images**: Use alt attributes for images to describe the content, improving accessibility and search engine understanding.

On top of that:

- **Internal Linking**: Make sure to use internal links to connect content within your web site, helping search engines crawl and understand the site structure.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Code your site and CSS with a mobile-first mindset. Ensuring the site is responsive and mobile-friendly to improve user experience and ranking on search engines.
- **Fast Loading Times**: Try to optimize images, use efficient code, and leverage caching to improve page load speeds. The faster the page loads, the bigger the advantage itâ€™ll have against other similar results on the SERP.
