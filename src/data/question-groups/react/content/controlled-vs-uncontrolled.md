JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. This makes the code easier to understand and debug.

It is basically a syntactic sugar around `React.createElement()` function.
