Inline conditionals in React are expressions that can be used to conditionally render elements. They are useful when you want to render different elements based on a condition. They can be used in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. Some examples of inline conditionals include the `ternary operator`, logical `&&` operator, and the logical `||` operator.

```js
<div>{condition ? <span>True</span> : <span>False</span>}</div>
```

```js
<div>{condition && <span>True</span>}</div>
```

> Note that you can also use the `if` statement, but it cannot be used inside JSX. It can only be used inside a function body.
