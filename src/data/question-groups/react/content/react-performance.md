To improve the performance of React app, we can use the following techniques which are not limited to. I would recommend to read [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html) for more details.

- Use production build
- Use suspense with lazy loading
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Memoize expensive computations
- Monitor performance with React Profiler
- ...

And more. Here's a test code snippet to demonstrate the performance of React app:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta
      name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"
    />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

In the above code snippet, we have a simple HTML page with no CSS and JS. Let's add a React app to it.
