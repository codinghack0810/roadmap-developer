  - question: What is Event Loop in Node.js?
    answer: |
      The event loop is a single-threaded loop responsible for handling all asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It continuously checks for events and executes associated callback functions, allowing Node.js to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently. Its non-blocking I/O model ensures that it can process multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for one to complete before moving on to the next, contributing to its scalability and performance.

  - question: What are modules in Node.js?
    answer: |
      Modules are reusable blocks of code that can be imported into other files. They are used to encapsulate related code into a single unit of code that can be used in other parts of the program. It allow us to split our code into multiple files and reuse it across multiple files. Some built-in modules include `fs`, `http`, `path`, `url`, `util`, etc.

  - question: What is the `global` object in Node.js?
    answer: |
      The `global` object is a global namespace object that contains all global variables, functions, and objects. It is similar to the `window` object in the browser. It can be accessed from anywhere in the program without importing it.

  - question: What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?
    answer: |
      `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` are both used to schedule a callback function to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. The difference is that `process.nextTick()` executes the callback at the end of the current iteration of the event loop, while `setImmediate()` executes the callback at the beginning of the next iteration of the event loop.

  - question: What are Event Emitters in Node.js?
    answer: |
      Event Emitters is a class that can be used to emit named events and register listeners for those events. It is used to handle asynchronous events in Node.js. It is similar to the `EventTarget` interface in the browser.
