# Processes

A process means program in execution. It generally takes an input, processes it and gives us the appropriate output. `ps` command can be used in linux to get the list of processes running in foreground. Each process will have a unique identifier called **PID**, which can be used to track it or `kill` it through shell.

**Types of processes:**
* Foreground processes 
* Background processes
