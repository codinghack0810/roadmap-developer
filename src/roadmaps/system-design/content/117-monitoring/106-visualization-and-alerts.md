# Visualization and Alerts

Instrumentation in system design refers to the process of adding monitoring and measurement capabilities to a system, service, or application. This allows developers and operations teams to observe the behavior of the system, measure its performance, and identify any issues or areas for improvement.

Instrumentation can be used to monitor a wide variety of aspects of a system, such as:

- Performance: Instrumentation can be used to measure the performance of a system, such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
- Errors: Instrumentation can be used to detect and diagnose errors, such as exceptions and stack traces.
- Security: Instrumentation can be used to monitor for security-related events, such as authentication attempts and network traffic.
- Usage: Instrumentation can be used to monitor usage-related data, such as the number of users and requests.
