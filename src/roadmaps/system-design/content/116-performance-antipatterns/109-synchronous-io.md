# Synchronous IO

In system design, synchronous IO refers to a type of input/output (IO) operation where the program execution is blocked or halted until the IO operation completes. This means that the program will wait for the IO operation to finish before it can continue executing the next instruction. Synchronous IO can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as:

- **Reading and writing files:** When a program needs to read or write a file, it can use synchronous IO to ensure that the operation completes before continuing.
- **Communicating with a database:** When a program needs to query or update a database, it can use synchronous IO to ensure that the operation completes before continuing.
- **Networking:** When a program needs to send or receive data over a network, it can use synchronous IO to ensure that the operation completes before continuing.
