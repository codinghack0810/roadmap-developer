# No Caching

Monolithic persistence in system design refers to the use of a single, monolithic database to store all of the data for an application or system. This approach can be used for simple, small-scale systems, but as the system grows and evolves, it can become a bottleneck, resulting in poor scalability, limited flexibility, and increased complexity.

A monolithic persistence can have several disadvantages:

- Scalability
- Limited Flexibility
- Increased Complexity
- Single Point of Failure
