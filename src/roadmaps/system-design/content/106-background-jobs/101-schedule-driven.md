# Schedule Driven

Schedule-driven systems are systems that are designed to perform specific tasks or actions at predetermined times or intervals. These schedules can be defined by the system itself or can be set by an external agent, such as a user or another system.

Examples of schedule-driven systems include:

- Cron jobs
- Scheduled batch jobs
- Recurring events
- Automated trading systems
