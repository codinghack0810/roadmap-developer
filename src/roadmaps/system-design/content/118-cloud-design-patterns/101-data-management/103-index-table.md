# Index Table

 An index table in system design is a data structure that allows for efficient lookup of data in a larger data set. It is used to improve the performance of searching, sorting, and retrieving data, by allowing for quick access to specific records or data elements. There are several types of index tables such as B-Tree, Hash table, and Trie each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Index tables can be used in a variety of scenarios such as searching, sorting, and retrieving.
