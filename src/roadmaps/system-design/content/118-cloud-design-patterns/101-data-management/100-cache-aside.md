# Cache Aside

Cache-Aside in system design is a pattern that allows for the caching of data, in order to improve the performance and scalability of a system. This pattern is typically used in systems where data is read more frequently than it is written. It can be used to reduce the load on a primary data store, and to improve the responsiveness of a system by reducing the latency of data access. Cache-Aside pattern can be used in scenarios like read-heavy workloads and latency-sensitive workloads. It can be implemented using various caching technologies such as in-memory cache, distributed cache, and file-based cache.
