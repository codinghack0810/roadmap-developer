# Publisher Subscriber

Publisher-Subscriber in system design is a pattern that allows multiple subscribers to receive updates from a single publisher, without the publisher and subscribers being aware of each other's existence. This pattern allows for decoupling of the publisher and subscribers, and can be used to build scalable and flexible systems. It can be used in scenarios like event-driven architecture and data streaming. It can be implemented using a variety of technologies such as message queues, message brokers, and event buses.
