# Asynchronous Request Reply

Asynchronous Request-Reply in system design refers to a pattern where a client sends a request to a server and the server responds asynchronously, allowing the client to continue processing other tasks or requests without waiting for the server's response. This can improve the performance and scalability of a system by allowing multiple requests to be processed concurrently. It can be implemented using callbacks, promises or event-based models.
