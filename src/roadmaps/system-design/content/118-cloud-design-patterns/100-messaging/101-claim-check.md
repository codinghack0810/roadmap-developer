# Claim Check

Claim check in system design is a pattern where large or complex data is replaced with a small token or reference, which is passed along with a message or request. This can help to reduce the size and complexity of messages, and improve the performance and scalability of a system. The large or complex data is stored in a separate location, and a token generator is used to create a unique token for the actual data.
