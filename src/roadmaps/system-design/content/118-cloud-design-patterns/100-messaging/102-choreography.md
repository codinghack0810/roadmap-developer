# Choreography

Choreography in system design refers to the design and coordination of interactions between autonomous systems or services, without the use of a central controlling entity. Each system or service is responsible for its own behavior and communication with other systems or services, and there is no central point of control or coordination. Choreography can be used to improve the scalability, flexibility, and resilience of a system, by allowing each service to evolve and scale independently. It can be implemented using event-based, message-based or API-based models.
