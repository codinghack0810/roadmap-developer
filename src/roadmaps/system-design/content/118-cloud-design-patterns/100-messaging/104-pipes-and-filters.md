# Pipes and Filters

Pipes and Filters in system design is a pattern that separates the processing of a task into a series of smaller, independent components, connected together in a pipeline. Each component, or filter, performs a specific task, and the output of one filter is passed as the input to the next filter. This approach can be used to build modular and extensible systems, by allowing filters to be added, removed, or replaced easily. Pipes and Filters pattern can be used in scenarios like data processing and data transformation. It can be implemented using a variety of technologies such as streams, generators, and iterators.
