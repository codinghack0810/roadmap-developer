# Competing Consumers

Competing Consumers in system design is a pattern that allows multiple consumers to process messages concurrently from a shared message queue. This approach can be used to improve the performance and scalability of a system by allowing multiple consumers to process messages in parallel. This pattern can be used in scenarios like load balancing and fault tolerance. It can be implemented using a variety of messaging technologies such as message queues, message brokers, and publish-subscribe systems.
