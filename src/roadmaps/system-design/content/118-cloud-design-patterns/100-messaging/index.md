# Messaging

Messaging in system design is a pattern that allows for the communication and coordination between different components or systems, using messaging technologies such as message queues, message brokers, and event buses. This pattern allows for decoupling of the sender and receiver, and can be used to build scalable and flexible systems. Messaging pattern can be used in scenarios like asynchronous communication, loose coupling, and scalability. It can be implemented using a variety of technologies such as message queues, message brokers, and event buses.
