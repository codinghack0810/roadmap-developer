# Priority Queue

A priority queue in system design is a data structure that stores items with a priority value, and allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the items based on their priority. The items with the highest priority are retrieved first. This pattern is useful in situations where certain items or tasks are more important than others and should be processed first. Priority Queue can be used in scenarios like scheduling and real-time systems. It can be implemented using various data structures such as heap, linked list, and array.
