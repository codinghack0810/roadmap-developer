# Queue Based Load Leveling

Queue-based load leveling in system design is a pattern that allows for the buffering of incoming requests, and the processing of those requests at a controlled rate. This pattern can be used to prevent overloading of a system, and to ensure that the system can handle a variable rate of incoming requests. It can be used in scenarios like traffic spikes and variable workloads. It can be implemented using various data structures such as linked list, array, and heap.
