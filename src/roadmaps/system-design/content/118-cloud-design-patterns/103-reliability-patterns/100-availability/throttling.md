# Throttling

Throttling in system design refers to a technique for limiting the rate at which requests are processed by a system. This is often used to prevent the system from being overwhelmed by a high volume of requests, or to ensure that resources are used efficiently. Throttling can be applied to incoming requests, outgoing requests or both, and can be implemented at different levels of the system, such as at the network, application, or service level. It allows to prevent system overload, ensure efficient resource usage, provide Quality of Service (QoS) and prevent Denial of Service (DoS). It can be implemented in several different ways such as Rate limiting, Leaking bucket and Token bucket.
