# Availability

Availability in system design refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended function without interruption. High availability is desired as it means that the system is less likely to experience downtime, and when it does, it can quickly recover. To increase the availability of a system, several methods can be used such as Redundancy, Load balancing, Failover, Monitoring, and Automated recovery.
