# Reliability Patterns

Reliability patterns in system design are solutions to common problems that arise when building systems that need to be highly available and fault-tolerant. These patterns provide a way to design and implement systems that can withstand failures, maintain high levels of performance, and recover quickly from disruptions. Some common reliability patterns include Failover, Circuit Breaker, Retry, Bulkhead, Backpressure, Cache-Aside, Idempotent Operations and Health Endpoint Monitoring.
