# Resilience

Resilience in system design refers to the ability of a system to withstand and recover from disruptions, failures or unexpected conditions. It means the system can continue to function and provide service even when faced with stressors such as high traffic, failures or unexpected changes. Resilience can be achieved by designing the system to be redundant, fault-tolerant, scalable, having automatic recovery, and monitoring and alerting mechanisms. It can be measured by Recovery Time Objective (RTO), Recovery Point Objective (RPO), Mean time to failure (MTTF), and Mean time to recovery (MTTR).
