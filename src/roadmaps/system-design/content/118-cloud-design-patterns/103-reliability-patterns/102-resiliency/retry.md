# Retry

Retry refers to the process of automatically re-executing a failed operation in the hopes of getting a successful outcome. Retries are used to handle transient failures such as network errors, temporary unavailability of a service, or other issues that may be resolved quickly. Retries can be an effective way of dealing with these types of failures, as they can help to ensure that the system continues to function, even in the face of temporary disruptions.
