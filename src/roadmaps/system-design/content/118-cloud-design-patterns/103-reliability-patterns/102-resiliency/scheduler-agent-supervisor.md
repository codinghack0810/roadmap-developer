# Scheduling Agent Supervisor

Scheduling Agent Supervisor is a pattern that allows for the scheduling and coordination of tasks or processes by a central entity, known as the Scheduling Agent. The Scheduling Agent is responsible for scheduling tasks, monitoring their execution, and handling errors or failures. This pattern can be used to build robust and fault-tolerant systems, by ensuring that tasks are executed as intended and that any errors or failures are handled appropriately.
