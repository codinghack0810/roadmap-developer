# Compensating Transaction

A Compensating Transaction refers to a mechanism for reversing or undoing the effects of a previously executed transaction in a system. It can be used to ensure that the system remains in a consistent state, even if a subsequent transaction fails or is rolled back. Typically used in systems that implement the principles of ACID transactions, it can be implemented in several different ways such as undo logs, savepoints.
