# Leader Election

Leader Election in system design is a pattern that is used to elect a leader among a group of distributed nodes in a system. The leader is responsible for coordinating the activities of the other nodes and making decisions on behalf of the group. Leader Election is important in distributed systems, as it ensures that there is a single point of coordination and decision-making, reducing the risk of conflicting actions or duplicate work. Leader Election can be used to ensure a single point of coordination, provide fault tolerance, and scalability. There are several algorithms such as Raft, Paxos, and Zab that can be used to implement Leader Election in distributed systems.
