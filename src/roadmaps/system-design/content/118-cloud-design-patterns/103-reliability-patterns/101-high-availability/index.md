# High availability

High availability in system design refers to the ability of a system to continue operating even in the event of a failure or outage. This is often achieved by designing the system to be redundant, meaning that multiple copies of the system are running at the same time, and if one copy fails, the others can take over. It can be achieved by using Redundancy, Load balancing, and Failover. It can be measured using metrics such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) and Availability.
