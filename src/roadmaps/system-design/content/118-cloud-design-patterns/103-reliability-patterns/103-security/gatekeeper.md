# Gatekeeper

A Gatekeeper in system design is a pattern that is used to control access to a system or service. It acts as a central point of control and decision-making for requests to the system or service and is responsible for enforcing policies, rules, and constraints that are used to govern access. It can be implemented in different ways such as API Gateway, Service Mesh, and Load Balancer. It can be useful for Authentication and Authorization, Traffic Management, and Observability.
