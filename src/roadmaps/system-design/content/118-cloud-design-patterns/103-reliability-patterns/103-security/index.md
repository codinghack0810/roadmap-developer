# Security

Security refers to the measures and techniques that are used to protect a system from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves identifying and mitigating the risks that the system faces and implementing controls to prevent and detect security incidents. Security can be divided into several areas such as Access Control, Data security, Network security, and Application security. It can be achieved by implementing best practices and standards such as Defense in depth, Least privilege, Separation of duties, and Monitoring and incident response.
