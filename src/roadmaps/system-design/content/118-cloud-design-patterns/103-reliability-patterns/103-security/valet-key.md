# Valet Key

A valet key in system design is a type of security feature that allows a user to grant limited access to a resource. It is commonly used in the automotive industry, where a valet key is used to allow a valet parking attendant to drive and park a car, but not to access the trunk or the glove compartment of the car.

In system design, a valet key can be used as a security feature to allow a user to grant limited access to a resource, such as a file or a service, to a third party. The third party can access the resource, but only with the limited permissions that have been granted by the valet key.
