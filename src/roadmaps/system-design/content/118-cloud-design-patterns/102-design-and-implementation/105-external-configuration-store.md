# External Configuration Store

An External Configuration Store (ECS) in system design is a centralized, external location where system configuration settings are stored and managed. It separates the configuration of a system from the code of the system, making it easier to manage and update the configuration settings. It can be used in scenarios such as centralized configuration management, dynamic configuration and environment-specific configuration. It can be implemented using techniques such as environment variables, configuration files, and distributed key-value stores.
