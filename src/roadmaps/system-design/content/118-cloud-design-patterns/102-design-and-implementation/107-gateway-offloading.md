# Gateway Offloading

Gateway Offloading in system design is a pattern that involves using a gateway to offload certain tasks or processing from the backend services or microservices to the gateway itself. This can be used to reduce the load on the backend services, improve performance, and provide additional functionality such as caching, compression, and encryption. It can be implemented using techniques such as API Gateway and Edge Computing.
