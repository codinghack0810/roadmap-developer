# Design and Implementation

Design and Implementation in system design refers to the process of creating a system that meets the requirements and goals of the stakeholders. It involves several steps such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The design phase involves creating a high-level plan for the system, including the overall architecture, the components that will be used, and the interfaces between them. The implementation phase involves taking the design and creating a working system using the chosen technologies and tools.
