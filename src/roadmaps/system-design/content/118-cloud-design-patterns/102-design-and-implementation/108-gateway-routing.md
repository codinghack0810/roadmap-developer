# Gateway Routing

Gateway Routing in system design is a pattern that involves using a gateway to route requests to the appropriate backend service or microservice. The gateway acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests and routes them to the correct service based on the request's information such as the endpoint, headers, or payload. It can be used to decouple the client and services, provide additional functionality, and scale the system. It can be implemented using techniques such as API Gateway and Service Mesh.
