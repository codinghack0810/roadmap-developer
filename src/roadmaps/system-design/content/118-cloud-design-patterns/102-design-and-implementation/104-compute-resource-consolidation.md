Compute resource consolidation in system design is the process of combining multiple servers, storage devices, and network resources into a smaller number of more powerful and efficient systems. This approach can be used to reduce costs, improve performance, and simplify the management and maintenance of the IT infrastructure. Compute resource consolidation can be achieved through several different techniques such as Virtualization, Cloud computing, and Containers. It can also be used to reduce costs, improve performance, and simplify management and maintenance.
