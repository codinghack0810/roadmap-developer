# Pipes and Filters

Pipes and Filters in system design is a pattern that is used to decompose a large system into smaller, reusable components that can be combined in different ways to perform different tasks. It is based on the idea of data flowing through a series of connected "pipes", where each "pipe" represents a processing step or "filter" that performs a specific task on the data. It can be used to decompose a large system, increase flexibility and increase reusability. It can be implemented in several ways such as pipeline and Chain of Responsibility pattern.
