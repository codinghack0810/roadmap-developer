# Strangler fig

Strangler Fig in system design is a pattern that is used to gradually replace a monolithic application with a microservices-based architecture. It's based on the idea of a "strangler fig" vine slowly wrapping around and strangling a tree, gradually replacing it. This pattern can be used to gradually replace a monolithic application, reduce the impact of changes, and preserve existing functionality. It can be implemented in several ways such as API Gateway and Service Mesh.
