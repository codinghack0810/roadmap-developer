# Gateway Aggregation

Gateway Aggregation in system design is a pattern that involves using a single gateway to aggregate multiple services or microservices into a single endpoint. This allows for a simplified client-side API and can also provide additional functionality such as authentication, rate limiting, and observability. It can be used to simplify the client-side API, provide additional functionality, and decouple the client and services. It can be implemented using techniques such as API Gateway and Service Mesh.
