# Backends for Frontend

Backends for Frontend (BFF) in system design is a pattern that involves creating a separate backend service for each frontend client. This allows each client to have its own API, tailored to its specific needs, while still sharing a common set of underlying services and data. BFF can be used to provide a tailored API, decouple frontend and backend, and reduce complexity. BFF can be implemented using several different techniques such as Microservices and API Gateway.
