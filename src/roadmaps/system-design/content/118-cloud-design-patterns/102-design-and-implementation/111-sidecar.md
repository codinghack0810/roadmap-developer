# Sidecar

A Sidecar in system design is a pattern that involves running an additional process alongside a primary process, in order to provide additional functionality to the primary process. The sidecar process is typically used to manage cross-cutting concerns such as logging, monitoring, security, or networking. It is used to provide additional functionality, decouple the primary process from the additional functionality, and allow for easier upgrades. It can be implemented in several ways such as Service Mesh and Sidecar Container.
