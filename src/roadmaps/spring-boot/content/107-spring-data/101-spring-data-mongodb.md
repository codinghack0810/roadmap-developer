# Spring data mongodb

Spring Data for MongoDB is part of the umbrella Spring Data project which aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for new datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities

The Spring Data MongoDB project provides integration with the MongoDB document database. Key functional areas of Spring Data MongoDB are a POJO centric model for interacting with a MongoDB DBCollection and easily writing a Repository style data access layer.

Some of its features are as follow:

- Spring configuration support using Java based @Configuration classes or an XML namespace for a Mongo driver instance and replica sets.
- MongoTemplate helper class that increases productivity performing common Mongo operations. Includes integrated object mapping between documents and POJOs.
- Exception translation into Spring’s portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.
- Feature Rich Object Mapping integrated with Spring’s Conversion Service.
- Annotation based mapping metadata but extensible to support other metadata formats.
- Persistence and mapping lifecycle events.
- Low-level mapping using MongoReader/MongoWriter abstractions etc.
