# Hystrix

Spring Cloud Hystrix is a library for managing the fault tolerance of microservices-based applications using the Circuit Breaker pattern. It integrates with the Netflix Hystrix library, which provides an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern.

Hystrix is a latency and fault tolerance library designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries, stop cascading failure and enable resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is inevitable.

Spring Cloud Hystrix allows developers to easily instrument their code and monitor the health of their microservices using Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer. It also provides a consistent programming model across different libraries, and allows developers to use annotations to enable circuit breaker functionality.

With the help of Spring Cloud Hystrix, developers can write code that will automatically fail over to a fallback method or response when a service becomes unavailable or unresponsive, thus preventing cascading failures. It also has a feature called a "Hystrix Dashboard" which provides a web interface for monitoring the health and performance of microservices and the ability to trigger, stop and monitor the fallback methods.
