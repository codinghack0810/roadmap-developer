# Spring cloud circuit breaker

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker is a library for managing the fault tolerance of microservices-based applications using the Circuit Breaker pattern. The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern that helps to prevent cascading failures and improve the resilience of distributed systems. It does this by introducing a "circuit breaker" proxy in front of a service that can detect when the service is unresponsive or has failed, and stop routing traffic to it temporarily, in order to allow the service to recover.

Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker integrates with popular circuit breaker libraries like Netflix Hystrix, and provides a consistent programming model across different libraries. It also allows developers to easily instrument their code and monitor the health of their microservices using Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer.

It also has features like fallback methods, request volume threshold and request timeout threshold, to handle the situation when the service is down or under heavy load, so that the application can continue to function, rather than failing completely. Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker also helps in managing the number of concurrent requests and preventing cascading failures, thus making the application more resilient to failures and improve its overall availability.
