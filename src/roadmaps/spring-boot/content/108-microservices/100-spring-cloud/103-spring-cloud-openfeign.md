# Spring cloud openfeign

Spring Cloud OpenFeign is a library for creating declarative REST clients in Spring applications. It allows developers to easily make HTTP requests to other microservices or remote services, without having to manually write the low-level code to handle the requests and responses. OpenFeign is built on top of the OpenFeign declarative HTTP client, which is a simple, lightweight library for creating HTTP clients in Java.

Spring Cloud OpenFeign provides a consistent, easy-to-use programming model for making RESTful calls, and it integrates seamlessly with Spring Cloud Netflix and Ribbon to provide load balancing and service discovery. It also supports other Spring projects such as Spring Security and Spring Retry. It uses interfaces and annotations to define the REST endpoints, so that the underlying HTTP request can be handled by Feign, allowing for more readable and easy to reason about code.

With the help of OpenFeign, developers can write simple and clean code to call the other microservices, without having to worry about the underlying HTTP request and responses, it also provides a lot of features out of the box like Retry, Circuit breaker patterns, Load balancing etc. This makes the code more readable and easy to maintain, also make it easier to test.
