# Microservices

Spring Microservices is a framework that makes it easier to build and manage microservices-based applications using the Spring Framework. Microservices is an architectural style in which a large application is built as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Each service has a narrowly defined responsibility and communicates with other services through APIs.

Spring Microservices provides a set of tools and best practices for building and deploying microservices, and integrates with other Spring projects such as Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Data to provide a cohesive and consistent development experience. It also provides a number of features that are useful for building microservices, such as service discovery, load balancing, and configuration management. With the help of Spring Microservices, developer can build, test, and deploy microservices more easily and efficiently.
