# Spring boot starters

Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application. They provide a variety of functionality, such as security, data access, and web services, and help to minimize the amount of boilerplate code and configuration you need to write.

Each starter POM (pom.xml) contains a list of dependencies and configurations that are known to work together. For example, the spring-boot-starter-web is a starter for building web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. It includes the spring-webmvc and spring-web modules, as well as a number of other modules required for a typical web application.

When you add a starter to your application's build, the necessary dependencies and configurations are automatically added, and you can start using the provided functionality right away.

Here are a few examples of popular starters:
- spring-boot-starter-web: For building web applications and RESTful services.
- spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For building Spring Data JPA based repositories and data access layer.
- spring-boot-starter-security: For adding Spring Security to your application.
- spring-boot-starter-test: For adding test dependencies and libraries such as JUnit, AssertJ and Hamcrest, for writing unit and integration tests.
  
There are more than 20+ starters available for various use-cases, with more being added as new features are introduced in Spring Boot. Using starters can make it easier to add functionality to your application and it gives you a set of well-known and well-tested dependencies, configuration, and defaults to help you get started quickly.
