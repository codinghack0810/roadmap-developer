# Mock mvc

Spring's MockMvc is a class that allows you to test Spring MVC controllers without the need for an actual web server. It is part of the Spring Test module, which provides a set of testing utilities for Spring applications.

MockMvc is a powerful testing tool that allows you to test your controllers using a mock servlet environment. It simulates the behavior of a real web container and allows you to test your controllers in isolation from the rest of the application.

To use MockMvc, you first need to create an instance of it by providing it with a standalone setup of your controller, this can be done using MockMvcBuilders. Once you have an instance of MockMvc, you can use its API to perform various HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. on your controllers and test the responses.

MockMvc provides a lot of flexibility and configurability, you can setup request headers, request parameters, test different type of request and response, test security and a lot more. It also provides a lot of assert methods to validate the response received by the controller, such as checking the HTTP status code, the headers, and the content of the response.

Spring's MockMvc is a powerful tool for testing Spring MVC controllers, it allows to test the controllers in isolation from the rest of the application, mock requests and responses, test security and a lot more. It also allows to catch issues early in the development process, making it easy to identify and fix bugs and improve the quality of the application.
