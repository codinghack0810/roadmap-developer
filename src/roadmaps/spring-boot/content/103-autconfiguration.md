# Autconfiguration

Spring Autoconfiguration is a feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures beans and other components based on the presence of certain classes and properties on the classpath. This makes it easy to add functionality to your application without having to write a lot of boilerplate configuration code.

When you include a dependency in your application, Spring Boot will automatically look for a corresponding "auto-configuration" class that can configure the necessary beans and other components. For example, if you include the spring-boot-starter-web dependency in your application, Spring Boot will automatically configure a DispatcherServlet and other components necessary for building web applications.

Auto-configurations can be fine-tuned by providing specific properties in the application.properties, application.yml or other configuration files. Spring Boot uses these properties to adjust its behavior and configure beans accordingly.

For example, if you want to change the default data source for your application, you can include the properties for a different data source and Spring Boot will automatically configure a DataSource bean for it.

Spring Boot also provides a set of annotations such as @EnableAutoConfiguration that can be used to enable or disable specific auto-configurations, such as @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class}) would disable the auto-configuration for the data-source.

In summary, Spring Boot's Autoconfiguration is a powerful and convenient feature that makes it easy to configure beans and other components in your application based on the presence of certain dependencies and properties. It saves developer's time by reducing the need for boilerplate configuration code, and can be fine-tuned through properties and annotations, to provide a fine-grained control over the auto-configurations.
