# Oauth2

OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that allows users to share their private resources (such as an API, a website, or a service) with third-party applications, without having to reveal their login credentials. It works by allowing users to authorize third-party applications to access their resources, without having to share their passwords.

In Spring, OAuth2 is implemented as a set of libraries, which can be integrated into your application to provide authentication and authorization functionality. The core library provides the OAuth2 protocol functionality, while additional libraries can be added to support different types of clients (such as web apps, mobile apps, or single-page apps), token stores, and user details services.

One of the most common ways to implement OAuth2 in Spring is by using the Spring Security OAuth2 library, which provides support for both the authorization code grant type (for web apps) and the implicit grant type (for single-page apps). You can also use Spring Security to protect your resources, and to configure your application as an OAuth2 resource server.

The OAuth2 authentication process can be complex and time-consuming, but the Spring Security OAuth2 library makes it easy to get started by providing a set of convenient configuration classes and annotations.

You should also be aware that Spring Security OAuth 2 is in maintenance mode , the development of new features or fixes is discontinued and you would need to use Spring Security 5.5.x or Spring Security 6.0.x to get new features and also Spring Boot 2.3.x or Spring Boot 2.4.x is recommended, otherwise you may face issues with compatibility.

It's important to read the documentation to understand how it works and what the best configuration options for your use case.
