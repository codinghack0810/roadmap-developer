# Authorization

Spring Security is a framework for securing Java-based applications. It provides a comprehensive security solution for both web-based and non-web-based applications. One of the key features of Spring Security is its ability to handle authentication and authorization for your application.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of determining whether a user has access to certain resources or functionality within an application.

Spring Security supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, such as username and password authentication, OAuth2, and more. Once a user is authenticated, Spring Security can then be used to authorize that user's access to specific resources or functionality.

To set up authorization in Spring Security, you can use annotations such as @Secured or @PreAuthorize to control access to specific methods or classes. For example, you might use the @PreAuthorize annotation to restrict access to a method to only users with a certain role, like so:

Additionally, you can use the "intercept-url" element in Spring Security's XML configuration or WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter's .authorizeRequests() method in Java Config to configure the URLs to which authorization checks should be applied, and use spring EL (Expression Language) to control access.

Overall, Spring Security provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how you can handle authentication and authorization in your application, and it's a powerful tool for securing your application.
