# Authentication

Spring Security is a framework for securing Java-based applications. One of its core features is authentication, which is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. Spring Security provides a wide range of options for implementing authentication, including support for traditional username/password-based authentication as well as more modern alternatives such as OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

The Spring Security framework uses a chain of **AuthenticationProviders** to authenticate a user. An **AuthenticationProvider** is responsible for verifying the credentials of a user and returning an **Authentication** object if the user is authenticated successfully. The **Authentication** object contains information about the user, such as their name, roles, and any additional details that are required by your application.

A typical implementation of an **AuthenticationProvider** would involve checking the user credentials against a database or an external service. You can implement your own custom **AuthenticationProvider** by creating a class that implements the **AuthenticationProvider** interface and overrides the authenticate method.

In the authenticate method, you'll need to retrieve the user's credentials from the Authentication object passed to the method and check them against your user store. If the credentials are valid, you'll create a new Authentication object and return it. If the credentials are invalid, you'll throw an **AuthenticationException**.

You can also use the built-in authentication provider classes provided by Spring Security, such as **DaoAuthenticationProvider** and **LdapAuthenticationProvider**, to authenticate users against a database or LDAP server respectively.

Besides the authentication part, Spring Security also provide authorization functionality, meaning it will check if the authenticated user is authorized to access certain functionality or endpoints.

In summary, Spring Security provides a powerful and flexible framework for implementing authentication in Java-based applications. It allows you to authenticate users against various types of authentication stores and provides a wide range of options for customizing the authentication process to meet the needs of your specific application.
