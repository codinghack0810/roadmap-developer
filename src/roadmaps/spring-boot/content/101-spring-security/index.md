# Spring security

Spring Security is a framework for securing Java-based applications. It is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework that can be easily integrated with a wide variety of applications, including web applications and RESTful web services. Spring Security provides a comprehensive security solution for both authentication and authorization, and it can be used to secure applications at both the web and method level.

One of the key features of Spring Security is its ability to authenticate users based on a variety of credentials, including username and password, as well as more advanced options like OAuth and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It also provides support for a wide range of authentication mechanisms, including form-based authentication, basic authentication, and authentication using X.509 certificates.

Another important feature of Spring Security is its support for authorization. This means that it can be used to control access to various parts of an application based on the roles and permissions of the authenticated user. Spring Security provides a flexible and powerful authorization model that can be easily customized to suit the needs of the application.

It also integrates well with Spring ecosystem, like Spring Boot, making it easier to setup and configure security on an application.

It provides a lot of useful feature that helps in securing the application by providing role based access, security on RESTful services and much more.
