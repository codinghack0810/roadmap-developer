# Spring Core

Spring is an open-source framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. The core module of Spring, also known as the "Spring Core" module, is at the heart of the framework and provides the fundamental functionality for dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC).

Dependency injection, also known as inversion of control (IoC), is a design pattern in which objects are given their dependencies, instead of creating or looking for dependent objects themselves. This allows for a decoupling of objects from their dependencies, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

The Spring Core module provides several key components for dependency injection, such as:

- The BeanFactory, which is an implementation of the factory pattern that provides a mechanism for creating and managing objects, known as "beans".
- The ApplicationContext, which is an extension of the BeanFactory and provides additional functionality, such as support for internationalization (i18n) and event-propagation.

In addition to dependency injection, the Spring Core module also provides several other features, such as:

- A flexible and extensible validation framework
- A type conversion system
- A consistent messaging framework

Overall, the Spring Core module provides the foundational functionality for building Java-based enterprise applications with Spring, and is widely used in many different types of applications, such as web applications, enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), and JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications.

Note that Spring Framework has a lot more modules to it such as Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Boot etc. All the features of Spring are not limited to just Spring Core.
