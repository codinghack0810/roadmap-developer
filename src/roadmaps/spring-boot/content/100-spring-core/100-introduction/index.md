# Introduction

Spring Boot is a framework for building applications based on the Spring Framework, a widely-used, open-source framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. Spring Boot aims to make it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can "just run".

One of the main benefits of using Spring Boot is that it reduces the amount of configuration required to set up and run a Spring application. It provides a lot of sensible defaults that can be overridden as needed, and it also provides a simple way to package and distribute your application.

Spring Boot also provides a number of features that can be used out-of-the-box to quickly build and deploy web applications, including:

- Embedded servlet containers (such as Tomcat and Jetty) to run the application
- Support for common development and testing tools, like H2 and Flyway
- Automatic configuration of Spring features, like data access and security
- Spring Boot applications can be built using either Maven or Gradle build tools. It also supports a variety of embedded web servers and also can be easily deployed to cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, and many others.

Spring Boot is a great option for building Java-based microservices, and is also well-suited to building the backend of web and mobile applications.
