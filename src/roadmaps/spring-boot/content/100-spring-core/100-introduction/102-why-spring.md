# Why spring

Spring Boot is a framework for building web applications and microservices using the Spring Framework. It provides a number of features that make it easier to create a Spring-based application, including:

- Embedding Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow directly in the application, so that you don't have to deploy the application to a separate application server.

- Automatically configuring Spring based on the classpath and other settings, so that you don't have to manually configure Spring yourself.

- Providing a number of pre-configured "starters" that you can include in your application to quickly and easily add functionality to your application. For example, the "spring-boot-starter-web" starter includes everything you need to create a web application, including Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat, and a number of other useful libraries.

- Providing a number of features to help you package and distribute your application, such as an executable jar file and the ability to run the application as a service on Linux and Windows.

- Providing a number of features to help you monitor and manage your application, such as a built-in health check endpoint and the ability to customize the management endpoint.

Because Spring Boot provides all these features in a easy to use and opinionated way, it allows developers to bootstrap and standup new spring based web application and services quickly and effectively. Additionally, it's come with a lot of best practices and conventions baked in, which reduces the amount of work and boiler plate code developers need to write.
