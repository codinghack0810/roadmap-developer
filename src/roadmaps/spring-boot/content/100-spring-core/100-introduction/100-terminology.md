# Terminology

Spring Boot is a framework for building Spring-based applications. It provides a set of features and tools to help developers quickly and easily create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Here are a few key terms and concepts that are commonly used when working with Spring Boot:

- Starters: Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application to add useful libraries and frameworks to your project. For example, if you want to add Spring MVC to your project, you can include the "spring-boot-starter-web" dependency in your pom.xml file, and Spring Boot will automatically add all of the necessary dependencies to your project.

- Auto-configuration: One of the key features of Spring Boot is its ability to automatically configure your application based on the dependencies that you have included in your project. This can include things like setting up an embedded web server, configuring a database connection, or enabling security features.

- Properties: Spring Boot applications can be configured using a variety of properties. These properties can be defined in a application.properties or application.yml file in the project classpath, and they can be used to configure things like the server port, database connection details, and various other aspects of the application.

- Spring Initializer: Spring Initializer is a web-based tool that allows you to quickly generate a basic structure for a new Spring Boot project, including a pom.xml file with the appropriate dependencies and a simple "Hello, World" application.
