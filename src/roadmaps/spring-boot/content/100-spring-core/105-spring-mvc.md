# Spring mvc

Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications in Java. It is part of the Spring Framework, which is a larger ecosystem of tools for building Java applications. Spring MVC is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps to separate the concerns of the application into three distinct components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is typically implemented as a set of Java objects that encapsulate the data and behavior of the application.

The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. In Spring MVC, views are typically implemented as JSPs (JavaServer Pages) or Thymeleaf templates, but other view technologies can also be used.

The Controller handles incoming requests from the user and directs them to the appropriate Model and View. In Spring MVC, controllers are typically implemented as Java classes that are annotated with the @Controller annotation.

Spring MVC provides a powerful and flexible way to build web applications, and it integrates well with other parts of the Spring ecosystem, such as Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Spring Data for data access.

The Spring Framework is able to handle the request/response flow with servlet and handlers, that's why it is known as "Spring Web MVC" or just "Spring MVC".
