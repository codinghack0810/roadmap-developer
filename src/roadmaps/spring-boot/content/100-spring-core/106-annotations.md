# Annotations

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework for building web applications and microservices. It is built on top of the Spring Framework, and aims to make it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. One of the key features of Spring Boot is its use of annotations, which are used to configure various aspects of the application and to enable certain features.

Some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot include:

- **@SpringBootApplication**: This is a convenience annotation that is used to enable several key features of Spring Boot, including auto-configuration, component scanning, and the ability to run the application as a standalone Java program.

- **@RestController**: This annotation is used to create a web service endpoint in a Spring Boot application. It is a combination of the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations from the Spring MVC framework, and is used to create RESTful web services.

- **@Autowired**: This annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean. It can be used on fields, constructors, or setter methods to indicate that the corresponding dependency should be injected at runtime.

- **@Value**: This annotation is used to inject a property value from a application.properties or application.yml file into a field. This allows you to externalize configuration from your code, making it easier to change settings in different environments.

- **@Enable**: Spring Boot provides several annotations that can be used to enable certain features, such as @EnableJpaRepositories, @EnableScheduling, @EnableAsync, etc.

- **@Configuration** : Annotating a class with @Configuration indicates that the class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.

- **@Bean** : Annotating a method with @Bean tells Spring that the return value of that method should be registered as a bean in the Spring application context.

These are just a few examples of the many annotations that are available in Spring Boot. There are many other annotations that you can use to configure various aspects of your application, such as security, caching, and data access.

Keep in mind, Spring Boot Annotation are extensive, you can use them to configure and customize the behavior of your application to a great extent. With the help of annotations, you can build powerful and flexible applications with minimal amount of code.
