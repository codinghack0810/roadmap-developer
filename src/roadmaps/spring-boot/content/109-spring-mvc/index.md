# Spring mvc

Spring MVC is a web application framework that is part of the Spring Framework. It is designed to make it easy to build web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

In Spring MVC, the application is divided into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application, the View is responsible for generating the HTML that is sent to the client's web browser, and the Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling incoming HTTP requests and generating the appropriate response.

The DispatcherServlet is the central point for handling requests in a Spring MVC application. It acts as the front controller, receiving all incoming requests and delegating responsibility to other components.

The Spring Framework provides a rich set of features for building web applications, including support for data binding and validation, flexible view resolution, and different file format support, such as JSPs, Thymeleaf and others. It also provides other supporting components such as the Spring IoC container, which manages the lifecycle of the application's objects, and various interceptors that can be used to add additional functionality such as caching and security.

Spring MVC promotes separation of concerns, testability and ease of testing, making it easy to build and maintain web applications.
