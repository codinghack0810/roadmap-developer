# Jsp files

Spring MVC is a web framework that is part of the Spring Framework, and is designed to make it easy to build web applications using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology for building dynamic web pages using Java.

In a Spring MVC application that uses JSPs, the view component of the MVC pattern is implemented using JSP files. The JSP files contain the presentation logic for the application and are responsible for generating the HTML that is sent to the client's web browser. When a user makes a request to a Spring MVC application, the DispatcherServlet, which acts as the front controller, handles the request and delegates responsibility for generating the response to the appropriate JSP file.

The Spring Framework provides a tag library called Spring Form tags, which can be used in JSP files to create forms and handle form submissions. In addition to this, it provides a powerful abstraction to access data from the Model, making it easy to display the data in JSP files.

The JSP files are typically placed in the webapp/WEB-INF/jsp directory of a Spring MVC application, although the location can be configured using the Spring's ViewResolver.
