# Paradigm Features

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects," which are instances of a class. OOP has several key features that distinguish it from other programming paradigms:

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Classes
6. Objects
7. Interfaces
8. Dynamic binding
9. Message passing

These features provide OOP with the ability to model real-world objects and their interactions, making it well-suited for creating complex and large-scale software systems.
