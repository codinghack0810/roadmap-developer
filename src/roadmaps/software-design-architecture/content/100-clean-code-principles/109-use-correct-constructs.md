# Use Correct Constructs

Using the correct constructs in system architecture is important for ensuring that the code is clear, maintainable, and efficient. Some common constructs include variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.

Here are some ways to use correct constructs in system architecture:

1. Use variables to store and manipulate data in a clear and organized manner.
2. Use loops to repeat operations on a set of data.
3. Use conditionals to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
4. Use functions to encapsulate specific functionality and make the code more reusable.
5. Use appropriate data structures such as arrays, lists, maps, and sets to organize and manage data.
6. Use exception handling to handle and recover from errors in a predictable and consistent manner.

By following these best practices, the system architecture will be more maintainable, testable, and less error-prone, and it will be easier to read and understand the code.
