# Keep it Small

Keep it small in system design architecture refers to the practice of designing and implementing small, focused components that serve a specific purpose, rather than large, monolithic components that try to do everything. This can help to improve the maintainability and scalability of the system by making it easier to understand, test, and modify individual components.
