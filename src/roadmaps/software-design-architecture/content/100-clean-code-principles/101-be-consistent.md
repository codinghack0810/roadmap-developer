Being consistent in system design architecture refers to maintaining a consistent pattern or structure in the design of a system. This can include using consistent naming conventions, data structures, and interfaces throughout the system, as well as adhering to established design principles and best practices. Consistency can help to make the system more maintainable, understandable, and extendable.
