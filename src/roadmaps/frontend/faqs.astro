  <Question isActive question='What is Frontend Development?'>
    <Answer>
      <p class='mb-3'>
        Front-end development is the devleopment of visual and interactive
        elements of a website that users interact with directly. It's a
        combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where HTML provides the
        structure, CSS the styling and layout, and JavaScript the dynamic
        behaviour and interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a front-end developer, you'll be responsible for creating the user
        interface of a website, to ensure it looks good and is easy to use, with
        great focus on design principles and user experience. You'll be working
        closely with designers, back-end developers, and project managers to
        make sure the final product meets the client's needs and provides the
        best possible experience for the end-users.

  <Question question='What are the job titles of a Frontend Developer?'>

  <Question question='How to become a Frontend Developer?'>
    <Answer>
      <p>
        Start with learning HTML and CSS; don't wait to fully master these and
        start building simple projects as soon as possible. You could try
        rebuilding the frontend of your favorite websites using HTML and CSS to
        start with. Do as many of these projects as possible as you keep
        learning. Once you are somewhat comfortable with HTML and CSS, start
        learning some basic JavaScript (DOM manipulation, making AJAX calls etc)
        and learn how to add interactivity to your websites. While you are at it
        learn some basics of Git and GitHub. At this point you should be able to
        get an entry level frontend development job. Keep revisiting this
        roadmap and try to fill the gaps in your knowledge.

  <Question question='How long does it take to become a Frontend Developer?'>
    <Answer>
      <p class='mb-3'>
        The amount of time it takes to become a frontend developer can vary
        depending on several factors, such as your learning pace, previous
        experience and the amount of time you are able to dedicate to learning.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-3'>
        However, to give you a rough idea, if you are a complete beginner, it
        could take you anywhere from 3 to 6 months to get a job as an entry
        level frontend developer. If you are already familiar with some of the
        frontend technologies, it could take you anywhere from 1 to 3 months.
        What's important is to practice as much you can while you are learning
        i.e. by building as many projects as you can. You should also
        participate in online communities and ask for feedback from more
        experienced developers to accelerate your learning process.
