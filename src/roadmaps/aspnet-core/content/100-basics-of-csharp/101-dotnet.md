# Dotnet

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. It is a modern, object-oriented language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. C# is used to create a wide range of applications, including Windows desktop and web applications, mobile apps, and gaming. The .NET Framework provides a large library of pre-built functionality, including collections, file input/output, and networking, that can be used by C# programs. C# also has features such as garbage collection, exception handling, and support for multithreading, which can make it easier for developers to write robust, high-performance code.
