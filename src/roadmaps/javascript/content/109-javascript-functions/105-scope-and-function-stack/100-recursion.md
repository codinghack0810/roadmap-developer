# Recursion

One of the most powerful and elegant concept of functions, recursion is when a function invokes itself. Such a function is called a **_recursive function_**. As recursion happens, the underlying code of the recursive function gets executed again and again until a terminating condition, called the _base case_, gets fulfilled. As you dive into the world of algorithms, you'll come across recursion in many many instances.
