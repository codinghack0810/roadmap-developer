# Number

It is a primitive data type in TypeScript that represents numeric values. It includes both integer and floating-point values.

For example:

    ```
    let intValue: number = 42;
    let floatValue: number = 3.14;
    ```

In TypeScript, numbers can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions. They are also compatible with arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, and % (modulus).
