# Enum

Enums is not a type-level extension of JavaScript. It allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

Example:

    ```
    enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down,
    Left,
    Right,
    }
    ```
