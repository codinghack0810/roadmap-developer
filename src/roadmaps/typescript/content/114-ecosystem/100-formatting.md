# Formatting

Formatting in TypeScript refers to the way code is indented, spaced, and arranged to make it easier to read and understand. Consistent formatting helps to ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across multiple developers and projects.

Here's an example of basic formatting in TypeScript:

    ```
    function add(a: number, b: number): number {
        return a + b;
    }

    const result = add(3, 5);
    console.log(result); // Output: 8
    ```

In this example, the code is indented with two spaces, and each line of code is separated by a line break. The opening brace `{` is placed on the same line as the function declaration, and the closing brace } is indented on a new line. This is a common style for formatting code in TypeScript.
