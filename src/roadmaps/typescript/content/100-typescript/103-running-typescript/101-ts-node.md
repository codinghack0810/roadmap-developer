# Ts Node

TypeScript is a statically-typed language that can be used with the Flutter framework to build cross-platform mobile apps. TypeScript offers features such as type checking, classes, interfaces, and more, which can help improve the development process and catch errors early. It can be used in Flutter by integrating it with the Dart programming language through a tool called dart2ts. This allows developers to use TypeScript with Flutter and take advantage of its benefits while still using Dart for the underlying runtime.
