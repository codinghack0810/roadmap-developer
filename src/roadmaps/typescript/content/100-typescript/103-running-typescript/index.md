# Running TypeScript

To run TypeScript code, you'll need to have a TypeScript compiler installed. Here's a general process to run TypeScript code:

1. Write TypeScript code in a .ts file (e.g. app.ts)
2. Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:
    ```
    tsc app.ts
    ```
3. Run the generated JavaScript code using a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js:
    ```
    node app.js
    ```
