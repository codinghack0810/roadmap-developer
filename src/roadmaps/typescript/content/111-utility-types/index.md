# Utility Types

TypeScript provides several utility types that can be used to manipulate and transform existing types. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Partial: makes all properties of a type optional.
2. Readonly: makes all properties of a type read-only.
3. Pick: allows you to pick specific properties from a type.
4. Omit: allows you to omit specific properties from a type.
5. Exclude: creates a type that is the set difference of A and B.
