# What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes can be described as a platform for managing and running containers. Containers are a type of virtualization technology that allow you to package applications and their dependencies into a single, isolated unit, known as a container image.

Kubernetes provides a way to deploy, manage, and scale these containerized applications in a clustered environment. This makes it easier to deploy, scale, and manage applications, especially microservices-based applications, in a consistent and reliable manner.

Kubernetes provides features such as automatic load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates, which makes it a popular choice for running production-grade applications. With Kubernetes, you can deploy, manage, and scale your applications in a controlled, predictable, and efficient way, regardless of whether you're running them on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid environment.
