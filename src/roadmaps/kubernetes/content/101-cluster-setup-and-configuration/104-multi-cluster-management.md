# Multi Cluster Management

Multi-cluster management in Kubernetes refers to the process of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single entity. This allows for the centralized management of resources across multiple clusters, making it easier to manage and deploy applications at scale.

For example, a multi-cluster management system might allow you to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters in different regions, and deploy an application to multiple clusters with a single command. Additionally, it can provide a unified view of resources across multiple clusters, making it easier to understand the state of your infrastructure.

Multi-cluster management in Kubernetes can be achieved through various tools and solutions, such as the Kubernetes federation API, and various multi-cluster management platforms like OpenShift and Anthos.
