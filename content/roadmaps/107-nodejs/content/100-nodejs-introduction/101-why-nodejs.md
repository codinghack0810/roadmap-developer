# Why Node.js

* Node.js is OpenSource
* Guarantees ease of scaling applications vertically by adding new resources to the existing node and horizontally with the addition of new nodes
* It facilitates building separate components that easily complement larger applications, which means saving money at the initial development stages and potentially shortening time-to-market, reusable code (some of the code can be used both on the front and backend)
* Tested on production (a lot of [companies use it](https://selleo.com/blog/10-successful-companies-using-nodejs) from the very beginning in 2009)
* offers improved performance thanks to Chromeâ€™s V8 engine
* using JavaScript on both backend and frontend makes Node a great choice to improve speed and simplicity of implementation
