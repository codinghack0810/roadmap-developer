# Programmer Errors

Programmer errors are bugs and should be dealt with in our code. they can always be avoided by changing some line(s) of code. Examples of such errors are; when a String is passed where an Object was expected, trying to read a property that is “undefined”, called an asynchronous function without a callback, and so on.
