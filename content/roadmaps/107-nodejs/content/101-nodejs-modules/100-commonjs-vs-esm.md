# CommonJS vs ESM

The CommonJS module system, on the other hand, is built into Node.js. Before the introduction of the ES module in Node.js, CommonJS was the standard for Node.js modules. As a result, many Node.js libraries and modules are written with CommonJS.

The ES module format was created to standardize the JavaScript module system. It has become the standard format for encapsulating JavaScript code for reuse.
