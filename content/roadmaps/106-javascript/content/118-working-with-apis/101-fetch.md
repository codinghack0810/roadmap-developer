# Fetch

Fetch or Fetch API is a modern alternative to XMLHttpRequest. Compared to XMLHttpRequest, fetch is cleaner, simpler and easier to understand. Fetch already uses Promise, so `fetch()` does not directly return response body but instead returns a promise that resolves with a `Response` object, which is a representation of the entire HTTP response.
