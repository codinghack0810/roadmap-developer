# Explicit binding

In this method, you can force a function to use a certain object as its this. Explicit Binding can be applied using call(), apply(), and bind().

call(): Pass in the required object as the first parameter during the function call. The actual parameters are passed after the object.

apply(): Similar to call() with a difference in the way the actual arguments are passed. Here, the actual arguments are passed as an array.

bind(): In this method, you create a new function with a fixed this. These types of functions created using bind() are commonly known as bound functions.
