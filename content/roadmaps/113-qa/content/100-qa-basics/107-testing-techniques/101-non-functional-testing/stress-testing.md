# Stress Testing

`Stress Testing` is a type of `Performance Testing`. The objective of stress testing is to identify the breaking point of application under test under extreme normal load.

e.g. injecting high volume of requests per second to an API might cause the disruption to its service or throws HTTP 503 Service Unavailable or cause other consequences.
