#Automated Testing

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

Automated testing is the application of software tools to automate a human-driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product. Most modern agile and DevOps software projects now include automated testing from inception. To fully appreciate the value of automated testing, however, it helps to understand what life was like before it was widely adopted.
