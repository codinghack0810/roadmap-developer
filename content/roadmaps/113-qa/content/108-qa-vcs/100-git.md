# Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It functions by using "repositories," which can be thought of like a centralized location that all the files for a specific project are stored in. Git keeps track of every change that is made within a repository and keeps a record of who did what and when, making it not only easy to see the history of a project, but also roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong. 

You can think of version control systems like a tree, where the main project is at the trunk, and then there are multiple smaller branches coming off of it. This allows individuals to work on one project at the same time by allowing them to "merge" their branch into the main trunk without disrupting anyone else's work.
