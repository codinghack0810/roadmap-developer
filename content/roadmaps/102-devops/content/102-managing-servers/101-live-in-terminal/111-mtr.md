# mtr

`mtr` combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic tool.

As `mtr` starts, it investigates the network connection between the host `mtr` runs on and `HOSTNAME` by sending packets with purposely low TTLs. It continues sending packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening routers. This allows `mtr` to print the internet route's response percentage and response times to HOSTNAME. A sudden packet loss or response time increase often indicates a bad (or simply overloaded) link.
