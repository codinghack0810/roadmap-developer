# fgrep

`fgrep` (**F**ixed **Grep**) command is used for searching fixed-character strings in a file.
It treats meta-characters or regular expressions in the search field as strings. For searching any **direct string** or files having meta-characters, this is the version of grep which should be selected. It works the same way as `$ grep -F` command.

It has the following syntax:

`$  fgrep [options] [string] [files]` e.g. `$ fgrep "search-string" file.txt`
