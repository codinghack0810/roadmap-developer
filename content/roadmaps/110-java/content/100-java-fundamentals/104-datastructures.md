# Datastructures

As the name indicates itself, a **Data Structure** is a way of organizing the data in the **memory** so that it can be used efficiently. Some common data structures are array, linked list, stack, hashtable, queue, tree, heap, and graph.

* Array allocates continuous memory for homogeneous data
* Linked List stores data in nodes with references
* Stack follows Last In First Out principle
* Queue follows First In First Out principle
